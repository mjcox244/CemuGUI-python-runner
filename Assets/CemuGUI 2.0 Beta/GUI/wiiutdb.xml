			<title>Bayonetta</title>
			<synopsis>From the creators of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil comes the free flowing over-the-top action, extravagant weapons, demonic hair and savage grace of Bayonetta. Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat.Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat &quot;em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn&quot;t taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she&quot;s not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that&quot;s only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta&quot;s hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you&quot;ll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.</synopsis>

Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat. Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat 'em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn't taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she's not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that's only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta's hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you'll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bowser)

Bowser crashes the latest Mario Party, the first installment of the series on the Wii U console. In the new Bowser Party mini-games, play as Bowser himself and face off against up to four others playing as Mario and friends. Control Bowser using the buttons, motion controls and touch screen of the Wii U GamePad controller in different ways, and wreak havoc as Bowser in each mini-game while the other players strive to survive.

FEATURES:

Grab the GamePad and play as Bowser for the first time in the series. In Bowser Party mini-games, one player gets to be the fire-breathing Bowser as he tries to burn, bonk or blast other players away. Up to four players use Wii Remote controllers to cooperate and survive as they confront the Bowser player, who is using the Wii U GamePad. It's four against one, and being a party pooper has never been so much fun!
Control Bowser in a variety of ways with the Wii U GamePad. In Bowser's Bad Breath, for example, the Bowser player moves the GamePad around to aim and shoot fireballs at the other players while they attempt to dodge them.
Colors and textures pop off the screen as the Mario Party series leaps into high definition for the first time.
Enjoy new mini-games in classic Mario Party style with up to four players.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Pikmin 3 is a fully reimagined, mass-action strategy title from the critically acclaimed Pikmin series. Players will discover a beautiful world filled with strange creatures and take command of a swarm of ant-like Pikmin trying to survive. The world is densely packed with treasures and enemies, which makes the game much more action focused and fills it with layers of potential strategies and paths, adding greater replayability to challenge modes.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Strength in Numbers

Earth is under attack from an invasion of enormous aliens, and the only thing that can protect the planet is a group of unlikely, yet mighty, heroes with special abilities. Unfortunately, the aliens are too powerful for the heroes to fight individually. They must join forces and work together to defeat their common enemy. These uniquely different

heroes can morph into powerful weapons to crush the invaders or turn into objects like a giant fist or bridge to interact with and traverse the environments.

Players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes you gather, the greater your Special Morph Powers will be.
Players can use the Wii U GamePad’s touch screen to command heroes such as Bonzai Man, Vending Machine Man and even Toilet Bowl Man. Heroes can also morph into gelatin to guard themselves from enemy attacks.
Players can also use the GamePad to explore areas unseen on the TV screen and solve puzzle elements.

			<title>Call of Duty: Ghosts</title>
			<synopsis>Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched:

Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

Single Player Campaign:

Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.

Multiplayer:

In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</synopsis>

In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</synopsis>

But for the first time, Mickey and Oswald will join forces as true partners – Mickey with his magical paint brush that wields paint and thinner, and Oswald with his powerful remote control that allows him to command electricity. This new co-op play combined with enhanced in-game physics will further enhance the idea that &quot;PlayStyle Matters&quot; – a unique approach to gameplay pioneered by Warren Spector where players dynamically tackle different challenges in order to explore all possibilities and storylines, but with consequences for their chosen actions.</synopsis>

But for the first time, Mickey and Oswald will join forces as true partners – Mickey with his magical paint brush that wields paint and thinner, and Oswald with his powerful remote control that allows him to command electricity. This new co-op play combined with enhanced in-game physics will further enhance the idea that &quot;PlayStyle Matters&quot; – a unique approach to gameplay pioneered by Warren Spector where players dynamically tackle different challenges in order to explore all possibilities and storylines, but with consequences for their chosen actions.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Show Your True Colors! Splatter enemies and claim your turf as the ink-spewing, squid-like characters called Inklings in Nintendo's new third-person action shooter game for the Wii U console. Challenge your friends in chaotic four-on-four matches, in which the goal is to get your ink on as many places as possible and claim your turf, all while strategically submerging yourself in your team's colors and blasting your enemies. This is a colorful and chaotic online third-person action shooter – exclusively on Wii U.

FEATURES:

-Team up and take on other teams in an action-filled battle to cover the level with as much ink as possible. Spray walls to access hard-to-reach areas.
-Covering more territory with ink unlocks powered-up super weapons that can be used to attack rivals or cover more turf.
-Strategy is everything. Defeat enemies to splatter them in an explosion of ink, covering more turf for your team. But choose wisely: Players who only go after the enemy might find their turf redecorated in their enemies' colors.
-Refill ink tanks, hide from opponents or move faster by turning into a squid and diving into the ink with the tap of a button.
-Select between multiple control options on the Wii U GamePad controller, including using gyroscopic controls to look around, allowing for better aiming and control.
-Hop online and battle in four-on-four matches.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Shantae embarks on her first full HD adventure! After three highly successful outings with Shantae, Shantae: Risky's Revenge, and Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, Shantae and her friends finally get a full HD console-based sequel! Boasting vivid, detailed high-definition graphics that retain the 2D hand-drawn sprites the series is known for, this newest entry in the Shantae series almost looks like a playable TV show! Presented as a stage-based 2.5D platformer with heavy exploration elements, Shantae uses her trademark Hair-Whip Attack to dispatch enemies, then takes advantage of her Belly Dance Magic to transform into 8 different forms that each have their own unique abilities and move sets. As new forms are mastered, old stages can be re-explored to unearth new items and secrets, ensuring there's plenty of content on offer for novices and platforming gurus alike. Topple the villainous Baron behind each criminal caper afflicting Sequin Land, and prepare for the ultimate showdown against Shantae's arch-nemesis: that bodacious buccaneer, Risky Boots!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>SteamWorld Collection for Wii U brings a peculiar platformer and an interstellar action strategy title together in the same retail package, only available in stores as part of the Nintendo eShop Selects range. Plumb the depths of an old mining town in SteamWorld Dig, then embark on an action-packed outer space adventure in SteamWorld Heist.

A fistful of dirt
SteamWorld Dig is a platform mining adventure, filled to the brim with treasures, terrors and quirky characters. Take the role of Rusty, a lone mining steambot, as he arrives at an old mining town in great need. Dig your way through the old earth, unlock upgrades to explore new areas, and uncover the ancient threat that lurks below the surface.

Shoot, loot, recruit!
Play as the admirable tactician Captain Piper and her ragtag team of fellow steambots as they explore outer space in pursuit of the galaxy’s dwindling water reserves. Your adventures will take you on board many enemy ships ready to defend their loot, so you’ll need to think tactically in order to survive tense turn-based side-scrolling shootouts.

SteamWorld Collection also includes SteamWorld Heist add-on content The Outsider, providing a new ally with a past shrouded in mystery, as well as new missions with brand new weapons, gear, and snazzy new headwear.</synopsis>

			<title>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</title>
			<synopsis>Ready for Adventure!
The intrepid Captain Toad sets off on his own adventure for the very first time through a wide variety of tricky, enemy-infested, maze-like stages to find hidden gems and nab elusive gold stars.
FEATURES:
-Equipped with nothing more than a neck scarf, backpack and oversized head lamp, Captain Toad finds hidden gems, coins and power-ups on his way to the gold star at the end of each tricky, trap-filled stage.
-Captain Toad isn't particularly fast or strong. He can't jump and he has no super powers. But he knows that sometimes, it's all about wits and perspective.
-Twist the camera to reveal hidden locations and other secrets. The Wii U GamePad offers a closer view of the dangers and hidden items in each maze, and its gyro controls can also be used to peer around.
-Captain Toad's world is brimming with life, with dangerous enemies, tricky platforms, nasty traps and secrets to uncover. Each stage is its own puzzle to solve, and littered throughout are hidden items in hard-to-reach places. Can you help our tiny adventurer survive to find them all?</synopsis>

			<synopsis>STEP INTO A WORLD OF ADVENTURE

 
Forget everything you know about The Legend of Zelda games. Step into a world of discovery, exploration and adventure in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a boundary-breaking new game in the acclaimed series. Travel across fields, through forests and to mountain peaks as you discover what has become of the ruined kingdom of Hyrule in this stunning open-air adventure.

Features:

Explore the wilds of Hyrule any way you like - Climb up towers and mountain peaks in search of new destinations, then set your own path to get there and plunge into the wilderness. Along the way, you'll battle towering enemies, hunt wild beasts and gather ingredients for the food and elixirs you'll need to sustain you on your journey.
More than 100 Shrines of Trials to discover and explore - Shrines dot the landscape, waiting to be discovered in any order you want. Search for them in various ways, and solve a variety of puzzles inside. Work your way through the traps and devices inside to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure.
Be prepared and properly equipped - With an entire world waiting to be explored, you'll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner. You may need to bundle up with warmer clothes or change into something better suited to the desert heat. Some clothing even has special effects that, for example, can make you faster and stealthier.
Battling enemies requires strategy - The world is inhabited with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Each one has its own attack method and weaponry, so you must think quickly and develop the right strategies to defeat them.
amiibo compatibility - Tap the Wolf Link amiibo (sold separately) to make Wolf Link appear in game. Wolf Link will attack enemies on his own and help you find items you're searching for. We will also introduce new the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild series of amiibo at E3 this year.</synopsis>

And in the Ultimate Edition on the Wii U, you can use Spidey’s in-game &quot;OsPhone&quot; through the GamePad to accept new challenges, navigate the city, and manage upgrades and experience.</synopsis>

Your living room becomes a party playground as you enjoy time together in comically themed board games and minigames that get everyone off the couch. Every kind of party can be found in this one unique package, which includes a Wii Remote Plus as well as a horizontal stand for your Wii U GamePad.

Have fun together with this new medley of living room party games! Four game modes change up the way you play with the Wii Remote controllers* and GamePad. Attend a game show that tests how well others know you, or dance together to familiar tunes in House Party mode. If you’re just looking for a short burst of fun, look no further than Minigames mode, which features tournament brackets and a solo dojo fest. Try TV Party if you’re in the mood for a board game. You can also shut the TV off and play two-player tabletop games exclusively on the GamePad, which range from foosball to baseball to slot-car racing.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The Penguins of Madagascar have returned and this time they're the stars of their very own game! Based on the upcoming film The Penguins of Madagascar, the game follows the adventures of Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private in the pursuit for their beloved Cheezy Dibbles. Along the way they stumble upon a nefarious plot by the evil octopus, Dave (Dr. Octavius Brine). The penguins travel from their Tiki Home Base to such locales as Fort Knox, JFK Airport, and Monte Carlo in an attempt to foil Dave's evil plans. Penguins of Madagascar is a stealth platform-er where players take on the role of any of the four penguin heroes and instantly swap between them depending on the situation encountered. For example, Rico, a demolitions expert, can blow up specific walls while Skipper, a martial arts expert, can perform a Stun Slap that temporarily pauses enemy Octopi. The penguins also make use of various environmental objects such as trampolines, moving platforms and conveyor belts to further progress in their mission. As the penguins progress more will be revealed about Dave's sinister intentions and many Cheezy Dibbles will be gathered along the way.</synopsis>

			<title>Puyo Puyo Tetris</title>
			<synopsis>The object of this head-to-head puzzle game is to clear your grid of falling patterns, called puyos, by forming chains of four or more same-colored puyos in a straight line or one of several geometric patterns. What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent’s grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent’s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you’ve won the game. An intriguing backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players. </synopsis>

Bayonetta 2 is a Wii U exclusive. Bayonetta comes packed in with the purchase of every retail packaged version of Bayonetta 2. Nintendo eShop purchases of either Bayonetta or Bayonetta 2 will include an automatic discount on the other game.

Features:

•Initiate the new Umbran Climax technique to temporarily summon demons and boost Bayonetta’s attack power and range whenever you fill her magic gauge.
•Fight with new over-the-top weapons that open new possibilities to the way you battle, including the Kafka, a bow that shoots poisonous arrows; the Rakshasa, a pair of beautiful katana blades; and a giant rifle-inspired scythe known as the Chernobog.
•Team up with a friend in Tag Climax, a two-player online co-op mode. Enjoy a little friendly competition by trying to deal the most damage as you work together to take down angels and demons.
In online quick matches, you can wager halos, the in-game currency that you earn by defeating enemies. You receive a large sum back if you can prove you’re a better fighter than your partner. Halos can then be traded in a story mode shop to unlock new techniques, buy accessories and pick up alternate weapon variations.
•Every chapter ends with a medal ranking: Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum or Pure Platinum. The more skilled you are, the higher your ranking.
•This game is approachable for players of all levels, with settings of three difficulty levels. Through Touch Play, you can play with the GamePad stylus and touch screen, regardless of which difficulty you choose.</synopsis>

			<title>Bayonetta 2</title>
			<synopsis>In this climactic sequel to the critically acclaimed Bayonetta action game, players will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Brimming with jaw-dropping battles and gorgeous cut scenes, this game never lets up on the action. Fight on top of a jet as it soars through a downtown city. Duke it out against a giant angelic monster with a deadly whip-like arm on top of a speeding train. And take to the skies in a fight against a demonic dragon while ascending to the top of a skyscraper.
The witch is back.
Born of a forbidden union between the Lumen Sages and the Umbra Witches, the mighty witch Bayonetta travels from the distant past to the present day. With her graceful fighting style and peerless magical powers, she captivates and terrifies her opponents in their final moments.
Armed with new weapons and abilities, Bayonetta has her enemies baffled by her new moves and torture attacks. Using magic, she can unleash a new ability called Umbran Climax to summon demonic monsters and deliver mighty attacks repeatedly.
Choose between Classic and Touch play styles. The Classic Controls represent the technical control scheme unique to Bayonetta, an acclaimed control scheme that fans of the previous game love and all action game fans will enjoy. The Touch Controls, on the other hand, offer a more convenient play style for those unfamiliar with action games or simply looking for a new spin on action. Players can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen controls to easily manipulate Bayonetta as she moves, attacks and evades enemies.
Bayonetta’s longtime friend and fellow Umbra Witch, Jeanne, appears to assist Bayonetta in performing combination attacks and in doling out intense punishment against enemies. You can even take all the action off the big screen and enjoy off-TV play using the Wii U GamePad.
Take the fight online.
Join forces with a friend to fight through waves of enemies in the online multiplayer Tag Climax mode. Choose from a range of powerful characters, and give angels and demons a beating that's as brutal as it is beautiful.</synopsis>

			<title>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</title>
			<synopsis>Help Donkey Kong and his friends get back their home from Vikings in the Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze game from Retro Studios. All the challenging ground-pounding, barrel-blasting and mine cart action from the Donkey Kong Country series is back, along with a bushel of new game-play elements and features.

Features:
Dixie Kong is back to join the adventure as a playable character alongside Diddy Kong.
Either can buddy up with Donkey Kong, and each character offers a different game-play experience.
Explore new dynamic levels that twist, turn and transform in new ways. Plus enjoy spectacular views from the dynamic rotating camera.
On their journey to reclaim Donkey Kong Island, Donkey Kong and his friends travel across five islands with a variety of stages that include underwater areas and frozen environments.
Enhance Donkey Kong’s exploration and unlock secrets with a new move that involves “plucking” items right out of the ground.
Team up with friends in a cooperative multiplayer mode that lets two players share in the fun together.</synopsis>

If you don’t have the boxed New Super Mario Bros U for your Wii U then this is the perfect addition to your gaming collection New Super Luigi U features the same Mario inspired gameplay but with a leaner and greener hero taking centre stage.

As in Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, Luigi keeps his higher jumping abilities and his looser traction as he runs for the flag post at the end of each stage. Also to add an extra element of speed each level begins with only 100 seconds on the clock.

In addition to the Luigi and the Yellow and Blue Toads, a fourth character will be available for Multiplayer, Nabbit. Already seen in New Super Mario Bros U, Nabbit was the thieving character that would steal power-ups when met on the world map. Nabbit is invincible to damage from enemies and world dangers such as lava, but you’ll still need to look out for those long drops.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>In Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, players take on the role of a powerful Portal Master, who can control over 30 different characters, including the beloved purple dragon, Spyro. Each of these heroes is a protector of an amazing, mysterious world, but they have been ejected from their world by the sinister Portal Master known as Kaos, and now, they are frozen in our world as toys. Only the players of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure can get them back into their world, by embarking on a fantastical journey where they will explore mythical lands, battle menacing, outlandish creatures, collect treasures, and solve challenging puzzles as a part of the quest to save their world. Spyro's Adventure changes the way others look at toys and video games, as well as how they interact with them by introducing action figures that become interaction figures and remember all of their dynamic experiences created in the game. For the first time ever, players can personally customize and power-up their toys, as well as bring them to life on a friend’s Portal of Power for co-op play and player-versus-player arena battles. Additionally, with the freedom to change characters whenever they like, Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure allows kids to utilize different interaction figures and strategies each time they play.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers have had enough of US military occupation all over the world and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on U.S. interests. When our nation is threatened, the president turns to one man and one man only: Sam Fisher. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad replicates Sam’s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones and the sticky cam through touch and motion based inputs. The Wii U GamePad allows for faster reaction times, letting the player mark enemies, switch weapons, quick reload and choose gadgets to adapt to any situation, among other features.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Set in modern Tokyo, young people come together to weave an epic tale alongside heroes from an alternate world. This brand-new RPG, developed by ATLUS, is infused with elements of the popular Fire Emblem series. In the struggle between the worlds of glamour and darkness, these young heroes rise to face the challenge.

'Mirages' – beings of immeasurable power hailing from another dimension – have begun to invade our world. Some are evil, but others are drawn to humans with tremendous creative potential and have shared their powers to guard humanity.

The young heroes fight as Mirage Masters and, at the same time, have big dreams to become great entertainers. They polish their singing and acting skills in the entertainment business in their daily life, and work as artists. They must confront not only the invading Mirages, but also the world of entertainment as they fight their way to stardom.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Once banished to Earth, the biggest heroes of the Skylands – the Giants – are back and ready to save the day! Watch as real-world action figures come to life before your very eyes when Skylanders Giants come to Wii U.

Simply plug a special platform called the Portal of Power into your Wii U console, start the game and place one of the Skylanders figures on the portal – then watch as it appears as a playable character in the game!

Assuming the role of a heroic Portal Master, it's your job to lead your Skylanders across the Skylands in an effort to stop the evil KAOS from wreaking havoc. Deciding which Skylander you use any given time, however, is a key component of the gameplay and being able to change characters at any moment simply by swapping figures on the portal is all part of the fun.

Skylanders Giants introduces a range of new Skylanders figures to collect (sold separately), 16 of which are completely new characters to the series. There are also eight special Lightcore figures that not only bring extra benefits to the game, but also light up in real-life when placed on the portal – without the need for batteries!

All Skylanders figures also have the ability to remember what they've done; from the special moves you teach them to the experience they earn, everything done in the game is stored on the figure itself. That means if you take your figures to a friend's house, they'll still be exactly the same as they were in your game and even know exactly who they belong to! And since co-operative gameplay is the order of the day in Skylanders Giants, you'll definitely want your friends to come and join in the fun.

Place any Skylanders Giants figure on the Portal of Power and watch as they come to life in the game as a playable character!

Collect a range of brand new characters and use their unique powers to overcome obstacles and challenges as you play alone or co-operatively with friends

Skylanders Giants figures store experience, special move and progress data and recall it when you place them on another Portal of Power, even if it's in someone else's game!

Compatible with all Skylanders Spyro's Adventures figures – increase your original heroes to level 15 by playing Skylanders Giants with them!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Wii Fit U reinvents fitness fun again with the Wii U GamePad controller, Wii Balance Board accessory, and the new Fit Meter. Carry the Fit Meter accessory to track daily activity, then sync it to your Wii U to compare accomplishments online. With over 70 activities, Wii Fit U makes fitness so fun it motivates you to get active and stay active!

The Wii Fit series makes fitness fun for everyone. And now with Wii Fit U, you can workout at home or on the go with the Fit Meter, a handy device that tracks your activity (i.e. calories burned, steps taken, elevation changes). Then sync the Fit Meter data to your in-game profile with one button press. Wii Fit U software lets you create routines, review progress, and compare with friends in online Gym Communities and Miiverse. Shape up with fun activities, from new ones using the GamePad to Wii Fit favorites. View your profile privately on the GamePad or get active with Off-TV play. Explore tons of options to create your perfect workout.

Shape up with a wide range of fun activities including Yoga, Strength exercises, Balance Games, Dance, Aerobic activities, and more!
Whether at home or on the go, the all-new Fit Meter tracks your progress, from calories burned to steps taken—even changes in elevation!
With the touch of a button, you can easily sync your Fit Meter data to compare your progress with friends or see how far you’ve gone in Walking Challenges, Altitude Challenges, and more.
Enjoy new and unique dual-screen activities like Hosedown or Trampoline Target that take advantage of the Wii U GamePad controller and your TV.
The Wii U GamePad offers both privacy and flexibility. By providing a second screen, it lets you perform activities while others watch TV, view personal progress on your own private screen, or even watch and adjust your form using the built-in camera.
Create, join, and browse online Gym Communities to share profile info (e.g. achievements, high scores, favorite activities) to keep yourself, your friends, and your family motivated.
Cheer on a friend or share parts of your Wii Fit U experience via Miiverse.
Create your own personalized workout routine with Yoga, Strength exercises, and other activities or select from recommended routines based on your fitness goals.
The new Dance activity allows you to choose from a variety of dance styles with varying difficulty levels.
Set goals and track your daily progress with easy-to-understand charts and graphs.
Choose a Mii character when creating your own Wii Fit U profile to help track your weight, height, age, and Body Mass Index (BMI).
Data from Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus can be easily transferred into a Wii Fit U profile.
Previous Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus owners who have a Wii Balance Board do not need to purchase a new one—the Wii Balance Board is compatible with Wii Fit U.</synopsis>

			<title>Watch Dogs</title>
			<synopsis>All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what's happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it's not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.

In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city's technology and holds key information on all of the city's residents.

You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city's network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.

Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.

    Hack the City: Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city's infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pile-up by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city's ctOS can become your weapon.
    Seamless Multiplayer Experience: Discover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.
    Stay Connected with a New Way to Play: Take your experience beyond the console with a ground breaking, real-time, companion game. This innovative mobile platform allows players to connect and compete with friends, even when away from their home console. The Watch_Dogs companion game delivers revolutionary dual-screen gameplay that enables you to play from anywhere, at any time.
    Street Justice: Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.
    High Octane: With help from Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series, Watch_Dogs offers a stable bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state-of-art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.
    Everything is Under Control: Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.
    Dynamic Navigation: Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city's ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through one of the buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.</synopsis>

			<title>Xenoblade Chronicles X</title>
			<synopsis>The next massive sci-fi role-playing game from Monolith Soft, the creators of Baten Kaitos and Xenoblade Chronicles, comes exclusively to Wii U. A terrible intergalactic war leaves just a handful of Earth survivors trying to live in a beautiful yet hostile environment. Players engage in battles against powerful creatures of all forms and sizes using the deep battle system that builds on the triumphs of Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii.

FEATURES:

Riding and controlling a weaponized mech, players can explore every inch of the massive open world displayed in gorgeous high-definition graphics. The world is filled with strange and imaginative creatures, from small bugs to giant dinosaurs.
As characters improve in different classes, they will learn new combat and defensive skills, or Arts. Players can customize the Arts palette as their characters learn new Arts. All Arts have a “recast&quot; time – once cast, the player must wait out a “cooldown&quot; period before that Art can be used again.
Players can customize everything about the main character's appearance, including gender, shapes, height, skin color, voice and tattoos.</synopsis>

			<title>Kirby and the Rainbow Curse</title>
			<synopsis>Kirby Like You've Never Seen Him Before!
Do you have the magic touch? Then guide Kirby as he sets off on grand adventures in a hand-sculpted clay world. Draw lines on the touch screen of the Wii U GamePad controller to create rainbow-colored clay ropes to move Kirby around freely, or tap him to attack enemies or blast through obstacles. Transformations include a submarine, rocket and tank. In underwater levels, Kirby dons a swim mask. If his power level gets too low, a clay bandage appears on his head.
FEATURES:
-Kirby comes to life in a world of clay, which creates a beautiful backdrop for Kirby's adventure.
-You take control of Kirby with the stroke of a stylus and draw on the GamePad touch screen to guide Kirby through the world.
-Use the GamePad to control Kirby's many transformations in unique new ways.
-The intuitive drawing mechanic is a spiritual successor to Kirby: Canvas Curse for Nintendo DS that builds on the game play and takes it in a new direction.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Set off with a friend through a wild, woolly world in this grand Yoshi™ adventure! A treasure trove of clever handicraft stages are ready for you to explore. Unravel their secrets and color your world with a spectrum of yarn balls to knit new paths and get every last collectible.

Knitting yarn, patchwork, and other handicraft materials combine into a whimsical and crafty backdrop for our knit Yoshi to explore. Instead of eggs, this time Yoshi tosses yarn balls that he can use to clear blocked paths, tangle-up enemies, or even knit together platforms and warp pipes. Yoshi can also tug at stray yarn to unravel walls and reveal hard-to-reach areas filled with hidden collectibles. Tackle challenges in local 2-Player co-op by partnering up with a friend. Gobble 'em up and spit 'em out to reach new heights or take out craftwork creepers like paratroopas, piranha plants and shy guys! It's time to get crafty.

-Toss yarn balls to knit together background elements or tie-up enemies
-Unravel puzzles and walls to discover hidden areas and collectables
-Explore each crafty stage to discover new surprises—there's no time limit
-Discover and explore new areas in 2-player cooperative multiplayer (additional accessories required for multiplayer mode; sold separately)
-Mellow Mode gives Yoshi™ wings so everyone can enjoy</synopsis>

This fear-fueled first-person shooter takes all the terror, chaos and tension found in the best of the horror genre and adds original interactive elements, including a unique death mechanic that puts players in the body of a different survivor each time they die, allowing them to track and take down their old, infected characters, recover their equipment and see if they can stay alive just a little bit longer this time.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Hit the floor for the year’s hottest party in Just Dance 2015 on Wii U! With over 40 tracks, including current chart-toppers and throwback favourites, there’re plenty of reasons to slip on your dancing shoes. Strut your stuff solo, dance up a storm in a duo or get down as a group in loads of modes that will keep the party going all night!
Select from a range of songs, including Happy by Pharrell Williams, Walk This Way by Aerosmith featuring Run-DMC, and many more – you can even hold your own block party with Tetris by Dancing Bros.! Feel the heat of the spotlight and lead the routine in On Stage Mode, while friends act as back-up dancers, or exercise your vocal cords in Karaoke Mode.
You’re more in-step with the world than ever with a range of new online modes. In World Dance Floor mode, join a virtual dance crew with friends or other Just Dance fans, then compete online in themed competitions, track your progress in global leaderboards and study the stats of fellow dancers. If your moves are smooth, you might even become a dance instructor for the whole world with the Community Remix feature: twice every month, you can use the Wii U GamePad’s camera to record yourself dancing, then share it online. Once the Just Dance Community has voted for their favourite clips, the best boppers will appear in special remixed gameplay created by the development team!
Share your stats and greatest performances, vote on community videos and make friends with the new Just Dance Wall, and never miss an exciting event thanks to the in-game calendar. In Challenger Mode, you don’t even need to play at the same time; now you can try to beat anybody’s score, from friends and family to top ranked Just Dancers around the world, and submit your score to the community. And if you’re looking for extra laughs, Autodance videos are automatically generated as you play, using footage of your gameplay to create short, hilarious videos that can be instantly shared online.Now it’s easier than ever to bring rhythm to your workouts. Build your own personal routines easily by creating custom playlists – or choose the non-stop shuffle option – then track how many calories you’ve burnt, how long you’ve been dancing and how many songs you’ve played. However you want to play, there are plenty of ways to dance the night away in Just Dance 2015 on Wii U!
•Get down to over 40 tracks, from dance classics to modern hits.
•Aim to become a dance coach for Just Dancers everywhere with the Community Remix feature.
•Form a crew and compete in online contests in World Dance Floor mode.
•Use the Just Dance Wall to keep connected to the Just Dance Community.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The Witch is Back.

The witching hour strikes again. Brimming with intricate battles that take place in, on and all over epic set pieces, Bayonetta 2 finds our sassy heroine battling angels and demons in unearthly beautiful HD. You’re bound to love how it feels to string together combos with unimaginable weapons and to summon demons using Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave in this frantic stylized action game. Bayonetta 2 is a Wii U exclusive. Bayonetta comes packed in with the purchase of every retail packaged version of Bayonetta 2. Nintendo eShop purchases of either Bayonetta or Bayonetta 2 will include an automatic discount on the other game.

Features:

•Initiate the new Umbran Climax technique to temporarily summon demons and boost Bayonetta’s attack power and range whenever you fill her magic gauge.
•Fight with new over-the-top weapons that open new possibilities to the way you battle, including the Kafka, a bow that shoots poisonous arrows; the Rakshasa, a pair of beautiful katana blades; and a giant rifle-inspired scythe known as the Chernobog.
•Team up with a friend in Tag Climax, a two-player online co-op mode. Enjoy a little friendly competition by trying to deal the most damage as you work together to take down angels and demons.
In online quick matches, you can wager halos, the in-game currency that you earn by defeating enemies. You receive a large sum back if you can prove you’re a better fighter than your partner. Halos can then be traded in a story mode shop to unlock new techniques, buy accessories and pick up alternate weapon variations.
•Every chapter ends with a medal ranking: Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum or Pure Platinum. The more skilled you are, the higher your ranking.
•This game is approachable for players of all levels, with settings of three difficulty levels. Through Touch Play, you can play with the GamePad stylus and touch screen, regardless of which difficulty you choose.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>In this climactic sequel to the critically acclaimed Bayonetta action game, players will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Brimming with jaw-dropping battles and gorgeous cut scenes, this game never lets up on the action. Fight on top of a jet as it soars through a downtown city. Duke it out against a giant angelic monster with a deadly whip-like arm on top of a speeding train. And take to the skies in a fight against a demonic dragon while ascending to the top of a skyscraper.
The witch is back.
Born of a forbidden union between the Lumen Sages and the Umbra Witches, the mighty witch Bayonetta travels from the distant past to the present day. With her graceful fighting style and peerless magical powers, she captivates and terrifies her opponents in their final moments.
Armed with new weapons and abilities, Bayonetta has her enemies baffled by her new moves and torture attacks. Using magic, she can unleash a new ability called Umbran Climax to summon demonic monsters and deliver mighty attacks repeatedly.
Choose between Classic and Touch play styles. The Classic Controls represent the technical control scheme unique to Bayonetta, an acclaimed control scheme that fans of the previous game love and all action game fans will enjoy. The Touch Controls, on the other hand, offer a more convenient play style for those unfamiliar with action games or simply looking for a new spin on action. Players can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen controls to easily manipulate Bayonetta as she moves, attacks and evades enemies.
Bayonetta’s longtime friend and fellow Umbra Witch, Jeanne, appears to assist Bayonetta in performing combination attacks and in doling out intense punishment against enemies. You can even take all the action off the big screen and enjoy off-TV play using the Wii U GamePad.
Take the fight online.
Join forces with a friend to fight through waves of enemies in the online multiplayer Tag Climax mode. Choose from a range of powerful characters, and give angels and demons a beating that's as brutal as it is beautiful.</synopsis>

			<title>FAST Racing NEO</title>
			<synopsis>Jump into the driver’s seat of an assortment of anti-gravity vehicles, then put them through their paces in high octane competitions at 60 frames per second. Try to become a legend by besting all three of FAST Racing NEO’s leagues, each of which ramps up the competition…and the speed! Tear through winding, twisting tracks that showcase stunning locales and realistic weather conditions. Skid along the ice as your cockpit view is buffeted by heavy snowstorms, weave between skyscrapers in a rainy high-tech metropolis, and watch out for sandstorms that can blow you off course! Use either motion or traditional controls to steer around tight corners, weave around obstacles and soar over hazardous jumps. By changing your ship’s phase you’ll change its colour which, when matched with the coloured boost panels on the ground, gives you a quick burst of speed! You can even race on the Wii U GamePad screen with off-TV play. Racers can find even more competition waiting for them in FAST Racing NEO’s multiplayer modes: take on up to seven other players online*, compete locally with three other players in split-screen local multiplayer**, and pit your best lap times against an online leaderboard. Shift things up a gear with the NEO Future Pack, purchasable add-on content now available from Nintendo eShop on Wii U*. The NEO Future Pack adds eight blistering courses, 10 brand-new vehicle profiles and two challenging cups for pilots to test their mettle against. Dodge solar flares, dive through urban canyons and battle giant turbines to stay on target for the finish line. Think you can handle speeds like this? Find out in FAST Racing NEO, an adrenaline-pumping arcade racer for Wii U.</synopsis>

			<title>Rodea the Sky Soldier</title>
			<synopsis>1,000 years ago, Emperor Geardo of the Naga Empire sent an army of machine soldiers to invade the sky kingdom of Garuda. Thanks to the efforts of Princess Cecilia and Rodea, a machine soldier who promised to protect Garuda, Emperor Geardo’s assault was thwarted.

In present day, a spirited inventor named Ion discovers an abandoned robot that has fallen into disrepair in the heart of a scorching desert. Upon completing her repairs, the robot stirs to life and reveals itself to be none other than Rodea. Stunned to find himself in the future, Rodea learns that the Naga Empire is no more and that Garuda has known peace for 1,000 years.

But this peace was not meant to last, for the forces of Naga have returned to wage war against Garuda. Remembering the promise he made 1,000 years ago, Rodea takes to the skies to defend Garuda from the Naga Empire once again.

Features:

Touch the Sky: Complete each mission by traversing the aerial kingdom of Garuda while solving puzzles and demolishing enemies! Upgrade your flight capabilities and take full control of the air to discover secrets of the past and hints of the future.
Delightful Tinkering: Explore each level and shatter enemies to collect Gears and Gravitons which Ion can use in her workshop to upgrade Rodea with new abilities and weapons, from upgrading his stats (such as health, attack damage, and speed) to powerful weapons.
Colossal Battles: Engage in battles on an epic scale as you combat the massive automatons of the Naga army. Dodge and weave in acrobatic combat as you evade the behemoths’ attacks and locate their weaknesses.
Endless Hours of Fun: Replay your favorite levels to better your time and uncover numerous hidden objectives and items. Upgrade your functions to set new speed records and increase your score.</synopsis>

			<title>Taiko no Tatsujin: Atsumete Tomodachi Daisakusen!</title>
			<synopsis>This installment inherits the signature multiplayer modes from the previous Wii U games (Baton Pass from Wii U Version and Intro Don! from Tokumori), with the addition of the new 'Buddy Attack' single player mode, in which Taiko sibling Kat-Chan tries to become a popular star by befriending wild animals from the streets with music. Content unlocking through the Mekadon Gacha and DLC supports make their return, as well as the coming of Nintendo-exclusive features to the game like Miiverse support and, for the first time ever, compatibility with Nintendo's Amiibo figurines.</synopsis>

This tour de force through the beloved locales of Hyrule will have players battling some of the fiercest enemies in The Legend of Zelda history. Two players can play local co-op, with one player joining with the Wii U GamePad controller and another with the Wii U Pro Controller or Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers (additional accessories are sold separately).

Features:

The delicate balance of the Triforce has been disrupted and Hyrule Kingdom is once again being torn apart by a dark power, this time led by Sorceress Cia.

Heroic Link carves through a huge onslaught of enemies as he executes flashy moves with combat attacks. This also marks the first time that many other iconic characters from The Legend of Zelda franchise are playable for any length of time, including Princess Zelda, Impa, and Midna.

Protect and reclaim recognisable landmarks from multiple games in The Legend of Zelda series, including such classic areas like Hyrule Field and the Palace of Twilight.

Push back armies of classic enemies from The Legend of Zelda, as well as powerful enemies making their debuts in Hyrule Warriors.

Advance the story to unlock new playable characters, each with unique moves and weapon types. Collect Rupees and other useful items to upgrade weapons and craft badges, which players can use to bolster each warrior's abilities.

Two warriors are better than one: Battle armies with a friend using local co-op mode, with one person playing on the TV and the other on the GamePad, providing each player with his or her own screen.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Fight your way across the celestial world of Avalice where cats are green, motorcycles drive up walls and monster girls do most of the buttkicking! Freedom Planet is a cartoony, combat-based platform adventure that pits a spunky dragonoid and her friends against an alien attack force.
As Lilac, you can whip enemies with your hair or use the Dragon Boost to fly through the air at high speed like a comet.
As Carol, you can bust through foes with a flurry of punches and kicks or summon a motorcycle that lets you ride up walls and ceilings.
As Milla, you can summon blocks to throw at enemies or reflect their attacks back at them with a psychic shield.
Help Lilac and friends save their world from war in an engaging Adventure mode with fully voiced cutscenes, or skip the fluff and play each stage in order with Classic mode. Do you have what it takes to save Avalice from the wrath of Lord Brevon and his robotic minions?</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Get ready to Runbow!
Runbow is an action party game with a unique art style and a never-before seen colour mechanic that will keep you running back for more. Platforms and obstacles appear and disappear as the background colour changes, so if you can't see something, it doesn't exist. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, Runbow is fast, frantic, and a lot of fun.
Players can race against each other in The Runbow Run, or go head to head in a number of different modes including King of the Hill and Arena to name a few. Use the Wii U GamePad to become the malevolent ColourMaster controlling the colours and the obstacles in the level, or tackle our toughest game mode, The Bowhemoth, a 30+ minute platforming challenge that will put the patience and skill of even the toughest players to the test.
If dozens of game modes, hundreds of unlockable costumes, and a crazy, colourful gaming challenge sounds like fun, then you better get ready to Runbow!
Local nine-player multiplayer
The biggest couch-multiplayer experience you've ever seen!
If you can't see it, it doesn't exist!
Players have to think fast as obstacles appear and disappear with the changing backgrounds.
60s Poster Art Aesthetic
Paying homage to the unique art styles of Saul Bass and classic Czechoslovakian film posters, Runbow is not only fun to play, it's fun to look at.
Hundreds of Levels
Packed to the brim with challenging levels! Endless permutations of colour transitions and obstacles!
Asymmetrical Fun
Play against your friends in ColourMaster mode, where you control the colours and the obstacles.
Dozens of Game Modes

Intuitive controls let you easily play through your quest solo or with friends. Pokémon Rumble U is the tale of the Toy Pokémon’s great adventure: after a mishap in the Toy Pokémon Shop, a few Pokémon capsules are swept down a river and washed up on a strange riverbank. Our heroes set out to find their way back to the Toy Pokémon Shop. Along the way they discover all is not right: can you help them discover why some of the Toy Pokémon are fighting each other, and what the enemy Pokémon are plotting? Up to four players can enjoy multiplayer battles, featuring co-operative play to defeat the strongest enemies with teamwork, or friendly competitions to see who can defeat and befriend the most Pokémon. Pokémon Rumble U features every last one of the 649 Pokémon that have been discovered as far as Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2, and hundreds of moves to master in battle. And the more Pokémon you defeat, the more Pokémon you can befriend, each with different strengths and weaknesses that will shape your battle strategy. Other surprises and pick-ups will crop up along the way – which will help strengthen the team, restore health, or cause damage to the opponents. Pikachu and friends will encounter Giant Bosses, and players can even use the Wii U GamePad to set off Touch Bombs when faced with many Pokémon in battle at once.
*All the fun of the Pokémon Rumble series comes to Wii U.
*Featuring all 649 Pokémon discovered up to Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2.
*Co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes let you share the fun with friends.</synopsis>

			<title>Teslagrad</title>
			<synopsis>Command electromagnetic forces as you puzzle your way through an ancient conspiracy in the steampunk-powered platformer, Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U. With no single word of text or dialogue throughout the entire game, Teslagrad keeps its cards very close to its chest: opening in a rain-soaked city, you are a small, nameless boy – a ‘Teslamancer’ – who can manipulate the twin forces of electricity and magnetism. As the last of your kind, explore the mysterious metropolis and, eventually, the Tesla Tower, to discover a terrible truth about a tyrannical king who once ruled the nation.
As you venture through this archaic, European-inspired world, dodging and drubbing its dangerous denizens, be prepared to flex your mental muscles – solve devious puzzles by using your powers to manipulate the environment, including switching the negative or positive charge of blocks and platforms to open up pathways, and reach new areas. Opposite polarity makes the targets attract, whereas similar polarity makes them repel. Give yourself a specific polarity to ride charged energy tubes, floating side-to-side, or circumventing crackling, electrical barriers designed to zap you! Polarise nearby critters, then send them off down small gullies and alcoves in order to affect otherwise-unreachable objects. By the time your reach the first of the hulking, industrial bosses, your electromagnetic prowess will be second nature! Keep pressing on, and pick up new items for more powers, such as a short-distance teleport to span greater gaps, then hunt down enigmatic scrolls that may hold the key to future events. With later puzzles reaching fiendish levels of difficulty, you’ll need to employ trial-and-error to successfully traverse the tower, especially as traps and creatures will do away with you in a single hit! Razor-sharp ingenuity and flawless logic are your sword and shield in this deep, mysterious place.
With over a hundred levels of retro, 2D platforming set in a non-linear world, plus Machiavellian puzzles galore, your mental and physical reflexes will be tested to capacity in Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
-Explore a strange, industrial tower through classic, 2D platforming action
-Use electromagnetic powers to move, float and teleport your way around enemies and obstacles
-Bend your brain by solving puzzles that eventually reveal an ancient secret</synopsis>

			<title>Shovel Knight</title>
			<synopsis>Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!

But, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!

The physical version of Shovel Knight contains everything we’ve released so far. First, there is the original Shovel Knight campaign with all the content you know and love! Also included is Shovel Knight’s first content update: Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows. Finally, there’s a full-featured Challenge mode with more than 50 crazy challenge levels to explore!

Of course, like the digital version, every boxed version will also receive FREE future updates as they become available:

Specter Knight’s Campaign – A full campaign starring the shadowy scythe spinner!
King Knight’s Campaign – A crazy campaign with the gilded goob himself!
Battle Mode – Duel with up to 4 players as your favorite heroic or villainous knight! (Wii U/PS4/XB1/PC exclusive)
Body Swap Mode – Did you ever wish Shovel Knight was a lady, or Shield Knight was a dude? Well, now you’ll be able to change them all around, along with the rest of the cast!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>An evil enchantress. A kidnapped lover. A legion of enemies. What’s missing? A tiny knight wielding a huge spade, of course! Welcome to Shovel Knight, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
As the diminutive warrior sworn to uphold the code of Shovelry – slash mercilessly and dig tirelessly! – take command of your ShovelBlade to despatch  enemies in this retro, 2D adventure, complete with 8-bit visuals and a chiptune soundtrack.
You’ll face the The Order of No Quarter, eight nefarious knights responsible for taking your lost love. Hack and slash your way through the land; upgrade your weapons and armour by digging for treasure; and unearth relics to upgrade your shovelling skills.
As you progress, the world stages can be tackled in different orders. Defeat the last level and you’ll be able to exhume all the secrets of New Game Plus: play from the start with full upgrades but fewer resources and harder enemies. There’s even a Challenge Mode chock-full of mini games!
You’re not on your own, though: Miiverse Digger’s Diary is a mystical tome that allows you to read in-game messages from other players. Bust out your quill to warn people about traps with anything from a simple word to a sweet illustration. You can even rate other players’ messages with a ‘Yeah!’
Shovel Knight on Wii U is pixel-perfect platforming with a huge dollop of nostalgia. Now, pick up a shovel and get digging!
*Perfect your platform skills to save your beau!
*Revel in vintage 8-bit aesthetics from yesteryear!
*Read and write messages through Miiverse.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Travel alongside four companions and a cat in a fantasy RPG featuring stunning animated turn-based battles! One year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light. Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. Although the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of destruction... Asdivine Hearts boasts of groundbreaking visual quality, plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to complete. By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a rubix, players are able to customize characters! How far can you level and how many millions of damage can you dish out? All these challenges await you and more!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Rescue your princess using magic cards Your princess is locked up in the last room of an intricate dungeon, guarded by a dragon. The keys to open the doors, are split in 16 parts. The only way to get these parts is solving a card game with magic cards. Let the adventure begin! The card game consists in clearing the board by taking a card that is one above or below than the card on the deck. Among the 160 levels available to play, you would find several missions. From level 6 you would have available a wild card, that you would be able to use any time replacing the card that you need. It's very useful for building long sequences. Each card taken off from the board has a value of 100 points, and if it follows a sequence then its value would have 50 bonus points. This means that the longer the sequence is then more points you get.</synopsis>

Take on the role of Mae Barrons; an Extreme Exorcist with extreme measures. Her supernatural skills are called upon when everything and everyone else has failed to rid a haunted house of its ghostly presence. Conventional methods won’t cut it with these ghosts. Instead, Mae comes armed with a deadly arsenal of ghost-busting weapons, from rocket launchers to razor sharp boomerangs. But these aren’t your average poltergeists. At the end of each round, a ghost appears and mimics your every move from the round before. The longer you survive the more extreme the game becomes. Engage in non-stop ghost annihilation in 10 eerie areas of the haunted house – each room presenting its own hellish hazard. Brave the winds on the balcony and the fire in the kitchen, surviving for as long as you can.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Super Meat Boy is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux. Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through crumbling caves and pools of old needles. Sacrificing his own well being to save his damsel in distress. Super Meat Boy brings the old school difficulty of classic titles and stream lines them down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex platforming. Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag Meat boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell itself. And if 300+ single player levels weren't enough SMB also throws in epic boss fights, tons of unlockable secrets, warp zones and hidden characters.</synopsis>

			<title>Girls Like Robots</title>
			<synopsis>Break hearts. Eat pie. Fight aliens. Everybody wants to sit by their friends. Arrange for happiness. Ridiculous seating arrangement puzzles, wrapped in an epic tale of love and danger, topped off with an authentic old-time stringband soundtrack! Their faces are the playing pieces. The rules are their emotions. Put every one next to their friends. Customize every face in the game with dozens of swappable parts. Better yet: Use the Wii U™ GamePad's camera to capture the varied emotions of your friends and family (or enemies or those towards which you feel indifferent). Did we mention competitive pass-and-play local multiplayer?! It's like playing chess but every piece is a picture of you sticking your tongue out. But you can't please everybody all the time. Sometimes you gotta break hearts to save the day. And the day definitely needs saving: Volcanoes, exploding chickens, planetary invasion and a boy who just wants to dance with a girl.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Shantae embarks on her first full HD adventure! After three highly successful outings with Shantae, Shantae: Risky's Revenge, and Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, Shantae and her friends finally get a full HD console-based sequel! Boasting vivid, detailed high-definition graphics that retain the 2D hand-drawn sprites the series is known for, this newest entry in the Shantae series almost looks like a playable TV show! Presented as a stage-based 2.5D platformer with heavy exploration elements, Shantae uses her trademark Hair-Whip Attack to dispatch enemies, then takes advantage of her Belly Dance Magic to transform into 8 different forms that each have their own unique abilities and move sets. As new forms are mastered, old stages can be re-explored to unearth new items and secrets, ensuring there's plenty of content on offer for novices and platforming gurus alike. Topple the villainous Baron behind each criminal caper afflicting Sequin Land, and prepare for the ultimate showdown against Shantae's arch-nemesis: that bodacious buccaneer, Risky Boots!</synopsis>

			<title>Jotun: Valhalla Edition</title>
			<synopsis>Explore vast and varied regions of Norse purgatory, do battle with colossal beasts called jotun and impress the Gods in Jotun: Valhalla Edition, a hand-drawn action-exploration game for Wii U.Wander the path of Thora, a Viking warrior who suffered an inglorious fate and must now prove herself to the Gods in order to enter the sacred hall of Valhalla. Scour nine levels across five punishing realms in search of hidden runes, then awaken and slay the mighty jotun using only your trusty axe and the blessings of the old deities of Asgard. Brave brutal snowstorms, cross caverns of fire and tackle waves of enemies on your journey to uncover the long-hidden lairs of the jotun.Each battle against the formidable jotun is an epic struggle against the odds, putting your nerves, reflexes and courage to the test. These hulking elementals possess unimaginable brute strength and powerful abilities, but their gigantic size and sluggishness makes them vulnerable to the nimble feet of Thora. Evade their devastating blows and magical spells with desperate dodges, then smite them where they stand with strikes of your two-handed axe.Along your journey, head off the beaten track to seek out Shrines and receive almighty God Powers. Strike fear into the heart of your enemies with thunderous hammers and razor-sharp spears, shield yourself with the spirit of Heimdall or replenish your health with Frigg’s gift of healing. Increase your health bar by consuming life-giving apples that hang only from legendary trees, and visit the rejuvenating Mimir wells when you grow weary of battling. You can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen to quickly and accurately activate God Powers in the heat of battle, making those split-second decisions more manageable. Adventurers can also glance down at the map without having to pause the game, allowing for seamless exploration.Delve into a rich and fantastical world, inspired by the ancient texts of Norse mythology. Learn of the holy world tree that connects all the realms of the land, and of Ginnungagap, the primordial void of creation said to be older than time itself. Brace yourself for lands of blistering heat, callous cold and everything in between, and encounter a number of legendary mythical creatures throughout your perilous journey. A marriage of gorgeous hand-drawn art, traditional animation and expert sound design bring the mystifying world of Jotun: Valhalla Edition to life with stunning clarity. Hear an authentic Icelandic voiceover as the story unfolds, while subtle ambient sound effects complement a rousing orchestral soundtrack, specifically composed for every gameplay moment.If you really want to prove your worth, take on even mightier versions of the gigantic jotun in the super-challenging Valhalla Mode. This intense boss rush mode adds a timer and measures key aspects of your performance, including how much damage you take, how many God Powers you use and the number of times you fall in battle, allowing you to easily compare your scores with others. Do not fail to impress – the Gods will be watching!</synopsis>

Here's where it gets tricky, because this isn’t the first time Gary's been late for work, and he could be fired if he's spotted arriving at his desk after everyone else yet again. So he'll have to prove he's smart and sneaky enough to make his way up all the 22 floors between him and his office without being seen. Hide in closets, crawl through air vents, slink along the walls… nobody must spot you! Use everything in your reach to get to the end of the level: hide behind a newspaper, smash a vending machine with a well-aimed kick, or use donuts. Want to booby-trap photocopiers, creep around under a cardboard box or give laxatives to your co-workers? From the basement to the boss's office via the research and development labs, explore the zany little universe of LEVEL 22, Gary's Misadventures.</synopsis>

			<title>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</title>
			<synopsis>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is comprised of three interconnected stories that converge to uncover the truth behind a recent string of tragic deaths in a forest marred by a history of suicides. As one of three people with the power of the Camera Obscura and the ability to see the shadows of those spirited away, you’ll explore the ruins of an eerie inn, a shrine filled with life-size dolls, and a lake full of dead priestesses. Each shadowy location is connected by a stream of water flowing throughout the mountain, and this once holy water is tied to the darkest mystery of all—the history of death and darkness on Mt. Hikami. This game is free to start. You can download the trial version and play most of the first two chapters for free. To continue playing, purchase the full game upgrade on Nintendo eShop. </synopsis>

Then there is the evil parallel universe, and special 2D speed-run inspired worlds. Lots of unexpected deadly twists, and surprises await! The star of the game features a space armadillo named Armillo. He's not your usual armadillo as he's capable of blasting off to space in order to travel from planet to planet. He's joined by his little blue critter friends and his brother. What's supposed to be a peaceful galaxy becomes ruined by the invasion of the robotic Darkbots. Where are they from? Why are they here? But one thing is for sure, they certainly are not the friendly type.</synopsis>

			<title>Neon Battle</title>
			<synopsis>Bounce into the game that changes the rules. Maneuver your way around the circular battlefield to victory in Neon Battle! Smash your opponent out of the way and yell obscenities at them without the threat of assault charges! Well, that's assuming you keep it in the game, with four different game modes to choose from and a selection of powerups, it's arguably more fun than smashing someone in real life, and definitely more fun than attending court hearings! Play solo or against a friend in a race to collect points by bouncing the ball and keeping it from going out of bounds! And for when your friends are busy/non-existent, you can play against the CPU!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Jump, dodge, and control the direction of gravity to survive for as long as possible in Don’t Touch Anything Red, a brand new autorunner for Wii U from Helix Games. Red things move fast, so you need to be quick to move out of the way! Dodge on your own or with up to 5 friends with multiplayer. Play on your own with the Wii U GamePad, Pro Controller, or even a Wii Remote. You can even play without the TV, with GamePad-Only support, so you can still keep control of the leaderboards… even if you’re not in control of the TV. In multiplayer, up to 4 players play using Wii Remotes or Wii U Pro Controllers, while a fifth player can cause havoc by using the GamePad touchscreen to craft the most difficult course they can! Choose between either a 4 vs. 1 or a free-for-all versus mode. With great music from the chiptune artist Kubbi, fast-paced gameplay, 5 player multiplayer, and unlimited replayability, it’s a lot of fun! Just make sure to never forget one thing: DON’T TOUCH ANYTHING RED.</synopsis>

			<title>Axiom Verge</title>
			<synopsis>Stand on the brink of discovery in Axiom Verge, a retro-inspired 2D action-exploration game for Wii U. Travel through a hostile alien world, discover scores of weapon and ability upgrades, and unearth your role in a mysterious and compelling sci-fi plot. After destroying an entire research facility on Earth with a failed experiment, rookie scientist Trace awakens in a strange, bio-mechanical world called Sudra. This nightmarish realm is a surreal meld of disturbing, corrupted lifeforms and towering technological structures, left behind by an incredibly advanced alien race long ago. Any sign of peaceful and coherent civilisation has long since abandoned Sudra, but a race of huge, sentient machines known as the Rusalki still reside beneath its surface, protecting the planet from ill-intentioned invaders. Trace quickly learns that the all-knowing Rusalki are slowly fading, and that their destiny is closely intertwined with the fate of the entire universe. Alone, you must run and gun your way through a vast, interconnected world, piecing together a mysterious storyline using the lore scattered across the isolated planet. The Wii U GamePad puts the world map in the palm of your hands at all times, helping you to navigate through nine labyrinthine, interlocking areas filled with secrets, surprises and huge, hideous boss battles. Axiom Verge is heavily inspired by the exploratory nature of classic adventure games from the 16-bit era. At the start of your journey, large parts of the map will be inaccessible, but by finding new items you’ll be able to drill deep into the bedrock, swing across chasms and even teleport through walls, opening up all-new possibilities. Assemble a range of unique and varied weapons to fight off the grotesque, violent monsters that call Sudra home. Lock and load the electrifying Kilver and devastate enemies at close range with a huge blast of lightning, or fire bouncing projectiles off of walls with the Reflector weapon. With over 20 wildly different upgradeable weapons to discover, you can mix up your play style and take the fight to the enemy however you like.</synopsis>

Trace quickly learns that the all-knowing Rusalki are slowly fading, and that their destiny is closely intertwined with the fate of the entire universe. Alone, you must run and gun your way through a vast, interconnected world, piecing together a mysterious storyline using the lore scattered across the isolated planet. The Wii U GamePad puts the world map in the palm of your hands at all times, helping you to navigate through nine labyrinthine, interlocking areas filled with secrets, surprises and huge, hideous boss battles. Axiom Verge is heavily inspired by the exploratory nature of classic adventure games from the 16-bit era. At the start of your journey, large parts of the map will be inaccessible, but by finding new items you’ll be able to drill deep into the bedrock, swing across chasms and even teleport through walls, opening up all-new possibilities. Assemble a range of unique and varied weapons to fight off the grotesque, violent monsters that call Sudra home. Lock and load the electrifying Kilver and devastate enemies at close range with a huge blast of lightning, or fire bouncing projectiles off of walls with the Reflector weapon. With over 20 wildly different upgradeable weapons to discover, you can mix up your play style and take the fight to the enemy however you like.</synopsis>

			<title>PixlCross</title>
			<synopsis>PixlCross is a nonogram puzzle game (eg Picross) where you use hints to fill in a grid and reveal a hidden image. With 150+ puzzles and 4 levels of difficulty, there's a diverse array of content with puzzles spanning from 5x5 to 35x35. But don't worry, you won't have to solve the big ones all in one go. PixlCross saves each move and allows you to jump back in whenever you want. If you ever get stuck, the hint system can get you back on your way. The Wii U™ GamePad makes puzzle solving intuitive: simply touch and slide along the grid to fill in and cross out boxes. Pop-out hints, boxes that count as you fill and auto-scroll make it even easier to tackle the toughest of puzzles. At any time you can hop over to the Puzzle Editor and begin creating puzzles of your own! With the power to detect ambiguities, you can create puzzles that can be solved without guessing. If creating isn't for you, just search for puzzles or enter puzzle IDs found on Miiverse™/social media to keep on playing!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Kirby Like You've Never Seen Him Before!
Do you have the magic touch? Then guide Kirby as he sets off on grand adventures in a hand-sculpted clay world. Draw lines on the touch screen of the Wii U GamePad controller to create rainbow-colored clay ropes to move Kirby around freely, or tap him to attack enemies or blast through obstacles. Transformations include a submarine, rocket and tank. In underwater levels, Kirby dons a swim mask. If his power level gets too low, a clay bandage appears on his head.
FEATURES:
-Kirby comes to life in a world of clay, which creates a beautiful backdrop for Kirby's adventure.
-You take control of Kirby with the stroke of a stylus and draw on the GamePad touch screen to guide Kirby through the world.
-Use the GamePad to control Kirby's many transformations in unique new ways.
-The intuitive drawing mechanic is a spiritual successor to Kirby: Canvas Curse for Nintendo DS that builds on the game play and takes it in a new direction.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Retro Road Rumble is an arcade-style game that offers the same experience that can be found in the classic tabletop arcade machines. Two challengers race head-to-head by taking either side of the Wii U™ GamePad to control their cars. Or, one player can race against the clock and strive to get the high score. With 8 fast-paced levels, each with unique events and environs, along with a day/night setting, no two matches will ever be the same. Retro Road Rumble truly gives players the chance to have the type of one of a kind experience that only the Wii U can offer!</synopsis>

			<title>Adventures of Pip</title>
			<synopsis>Adventures of Pip revitalizes the classic side-scrolling action platform genre. Pip -- the ultimate digital underdog – is a lowly single pixel in a 32-bit world who proves that you can’t judge a hero by the fidelity of his shaders. During the game, Pip gains the ability to evolve and grow by absorbing pixels from his fallen foes. Those same pixels can then be used to blast through environment puzzles and enemies, devolving Pip back to a single pixel. Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip’s village from the evil Queen DeRezzia.

Inspired by classic platformers, Adventures of Pip basks in a world where players can defeat a huge 32-bit boss as a single pixel or even as an 8-bit character.

With three different forms, evolve and devolve Pip to solve puzzles and defeat enemies; each with their own weakness and strength that must be unraveled throughout the campaign.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Uncover the sinister truth surrounding Elysia, a mystifying cyber-world where memories and dreams are stored, accessed and re-lived. Immerse yourself in a deep, thought-provoking narrative as you try to piece together your identity, make sense of the world around you and expose an unsettling conspiracy. But beware: some mysteries are better left unsolved... The year is 2027, and mankind’s greatest scientists have pioneered a major breakthrough in the quest for eternal life with the invention of Digital Soul Providers – sprawling servers that preserve digital interpretations of the very essence of human life on a huge network. As the latest product of this technology, Elysia garners universal acclaim and prestigious accolades from all corners of society, even being named by critics as “the single most important development in the history of the human race” (Era Magazine, 2027). On the surface, Elysia does indeed appear to be a veritable utopia – its users are free to explore their most precious and cherished memories for eternity, freed from the limitations of a worldly existence. But not all is as it seems, and something sinister is afoot. In the midst of a ferocious lightning storm, you are plunged headfirst into the depths of Elysia, where hazy visions provide the only clues to your identity and history. Waking on a strange ship, you see a winged apparition emerge from the darkness and destroy the vessel, tossing you into the barren wastes below. To discover the truth of who you are and how you got here, you must journey across the hauntingly beautiful, neon-soaked landscapes of Elysia, solving puzzles and collecting a wealth of lore from 40 unique locales as you go. Explore every inch of ancient desert ruins, navigate palaces and university buildings, and trek through tropical jungles in search of clues and remnants of the outside world. Utilise powerful abilities known as ‘hand powers’ to manipulate time and fade objects in and out of existence as you directly influence the very fabric of the world around you. Unlock and use the Phase, Play, Destroy and Corrupt abilities to solve mind-bending puzzles and bring to light the disturbing activities of those who created Elysia. Experience a compelling plot full of intrigue and suspense, expertly crafted by award-winning developer Wales Interactive. Meet a cast of mysterious characters whose fates will become intertwined with yours, resulting in a number of branching story paths and multiple endings to discover. Discover Elysia. Then, now and forever.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Don't let the comic look fool you. Being a good RGB agent requires a lot of talent. Spy Chameleon is an arcade-puzzle game where the player must avoid being seen thanks to the chameleon's ability to change colors and camouflage.

			<title>Ghost Blade HD</title>
			<synopsis>Ghost Blade HD is an intense bullet-hell shoot 'em up game, with satisfying and addictive score-based gameplay, with its tradition going back to the shooting games of the 1990s era. Designed with a modern graphic style and special effects, Ghost Blade also features an awesome 2-player mode! Ghost Blade HD Is easy to learn, yet hard to master. The Soundtrack based on the heydays of Japanese shmups and arcade sounds: Composer Rafael Dyll has already scored several console games (Söldner X-2. Rainbow Moon) and returns to his signature sound with the music featured in The Ghost Blade. Fusing J-Pop influences and typical 90s synths and with modern production values, Rafael provides an action-packed soundtrack with catchy leads and electronic beats. 10,000 years ago an Artificial Intelligence known as Shira was built to protect the residents of Mars. As time passed the AI became corrupted and Shira started to attack the Mars colonies. With no way to defend itself against &quot;Evil Shira&quot; Mars calls for help. The Earth Defense Force fleet fights its way to Evil Shira and uses powerful lasers to destroy it. However, 'Evil Shira' secretly had a backup that flees into space and takes over an abandoned space station at the outskirts of the solar system. When the EDF notices the escape they send their bravest fighter after Evil Shira. You are this pilot, and your mission is to destroy Evil Shira before it can complete its new attack force and threaten the existence of the entire universe.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>High Strangeness is a hybrid of 8 and 16 bit games - a 12 bit adventure. The inspiration of the game comes from many Action-Adventure and RPG games of yesteryear. The game's core ability is to switch between 8 and 16 bit worlds and the player uses their generational differences to solve puzzles and explore the universe. Throughout the game your pixel art perspective of the world will be infused with visions of watercolor illustrations that shed some light on your mysterious surroundings. The chiptune soundtrack by Dino Lionetti and Rich Vreeland backs up the aesthetic of the world and sets the mood for strange happenings. </synopsis>

While at EnderCon in hopes of meeting Gabriel the Warrior, you and your friends discover that something is wrong… something dreadful.

Created by award-winning adventure game powerhouse Telltale Games, in partnership with Minecraft creators, Mojang.

			<title>PONCHO</title>
			<synopsis>Explore a charming 2D open world where humans have been extinct for centuries and the robotic creations they left behind struggle, without their masters, to find a new purpose in life. Dropped into the middle of this world, and with no guide to speak of, you’ll have to find your own way through the overgrown flora and fauna if you hope to find your Maker. Encounter new friends along the way, chat with robot tribes fending for themselves and interact with randomly-generated wildlife in this beautifully realised post-apocalyptic pixel world. There’s always more than one way to accomplish your goals! When puzzles leave you perplexed, try a new perspective: shift between the background, middle ground, and foreground to find a solution, a new path or uncover one of the many treasures crammed into every nook and cranny. Hone your spatial awareness as you deal with platforms that move with you, walls that shift in rhythm, and other hazards in this little robot’s way. You can even upgrade your robotic abilities with the Merchant bot to bolster your platforming powers and discover whole new areas. Help your mechanical hero piece together revelations of the past and make difficult choices that will ultimately determine the fate of humankind in PONCHO for Wii U.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Play as Tikiman, the Forest Defender. He's in trouble, with hordes of monsters sweeping through his realm, hoping to chow down on his offspring – and it's up to you to defend them! By placing weapon towers at strategic points around the landscape, you can destroy the invaders and save the little ones. Choose from a whole host of towers: Arrow Towers, Cannon Towers, Anti-Air Towers, Ice Towers, Fire Towers, Laser Towers, Tesla Towers, Mortar Towers, special power ups and more! Collect treasure along the way to build up your arsenal and pay for new towers – countless waves of monsters are out to get the babies, so you need to be prepared to battle! Travel across 3 distinct islands, spanning 47 unique environments to protect Tikiman's offspring from clever monsters that attack by land and air.
Play together with a friend with local co-op for a memorable shared experience. There is also the mysterious Tum-Tum Island that randomly generates levels for near infinite replayability!</synopsis>

			<title>Sudoku and Permudoku</title>
			<synopsis>Sudoku and Permudoku is a puzzle game that offers two distinct styles of logic puzzles. In the Sudoku mode, the player is tasked to fill out a 9 x 9 field with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column and each 3 x 3 sub-field contains exactly one occurance of each of the numbers 1 to 9. Permudoku is a variation of the classic Sudoku puzzle, where instead of numbers, colours have to be placed on a 9 x 9 in such a way that each colour appears exactly once in each column, row and 3 x 3 sub-field. However, from the beginning, all fields are already coloured, the player's task is to swap fields around until the colours are distributed correctly. Both game modes include five different degrees of difficulty with 100 puzzles each, for a total of 1000 puzzles.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The Swindle is a crime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking, stealing and getting away fast.

The Swindle is a steampunk cybercrime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking their systems, stealing all their cash, and quickly running away again before the police show up.

London, 1849. Scotland Yard will soon activate its breakthrough surveillance technology, &quot;The Devil's Basilisk&quot;. Its surveillance capabilities will be total and your career as a master thief will be over.

Steal it, before that can happen.

From the safety of your rickety airship, you can modify your thief with new skills, tools, and all manner of technological horrors to tackle the richest and most secure buildings in London.

All the buildings you'll be robbing are randomly-generated, so you'll never get the same level twice.

Have you got what it takes to pull off The Swindle?</synopsis>

			<title>Severed</title>
			<synopsis>Cut free from a nightmarish dimension in Severed, a first-person dungeon crawler with unique touch controls for Nintendo eShop on Wii U. Wield the immense power of a living sword and slice through enemies in tactical battles to save your family from a grim fate. One night, you awaken in a strange place, dazed and confused. You come across a house that looks suspiciously like your own and decide to investigate. Inside, you glimpse a mirror – your reflection stares back at you, but something is horribly wrong. Your arm has been severed from your body, and visions of your family being dragged into a strange realm by unknown forces scream through your head. A grotesque creature appears behind you, grants you a sword and tells you that, though this house may seem like your home, it is not. You’ve been transported into a strange void along with your family, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Now, you must embark on a perilous journey to find them and return home. Navigate creative, maze-like dungeons – some of which are huge, living creatures – filled with unnerving beasts, treacherous traps and perplexing puzzles. Move around in a first-person perspective and closely survey your surroundings for clues as you journey into the unknown. Throughout your eerie adventure, you’ll be confronted by all sorts of terrifying and monstrous creatures. By swiping on the Wii U GamePad touch screen, you can swing your sword in different directions – slash away at the ghoulish monsters to inflict damage, or parry their attacks in defence. Use long swiping motions to deal more damage, and strike at precise angles to devastate weak spots in enemy armour. When you’re surrounded by enemies, battles become a frantic and frenzied mix of careful observation and furious sword swinging. Each type of enemy has its own attack pattern that you’ll need to study and memorise. Keep an eye out for any enemies that are about to attack, then quickly turn to face them and unleash a flurry of melee attacks to keep the beast at bay. Juggling multiple enemies is a trying test of your time management, dexterity and reflexes. Chain together combos to build your Focus meter. When your Focus is maxed, activate the finishing Sever Mode for a chance to detach enemy limbs, then use them to upgrade a number of skills. If you successfully Sever a boss, you’ll be able to create sturdy armour from the spoils, granting you powerful new abilities. Incapacitate foes with the Blind ability, go into a fiery Rage to deal more damage, or Devour magical enemy buffs to use them as your own and dominate the opposition. Revisit areas with new powers to get a fresh perspective and find hidden secrets. Once you unlock the Charge Slash, you’ll be able to deliver more powerful strikes in combat and smash through obstructions that once blocked your path, opening up new areas. Experience a unique touch adventure that’s a cut above in Severed, an otherworldly dungeon-crawler for Nintendo eShop on Wii U.</synopsis>

			<title>Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut</title>
			<synopsis>In this psychological survival adventure, the masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary. Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is a new kind of adventure where the choice of how to survive is up to you. Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path. Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going. Search for survivors, or try to escape the city alone. Look after your mental health, or descend into madness. Lone Survivor is a game where your choices genuinely matter. This extended edition of Jasper Byrne's horror masterpiece expands Lone Survivor's deep story with hundreds of tiny new details, more locations, more dialogue, more side quests, more craftable items, and even two completely new endings. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut really is the ultimate version of this acclaimed game.</synopsis>

			<title>Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut</title>
			<synopsis>In this psychological survival adventure, the masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary. Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is a new kind of adventure where the choice of how to survive is up to you. Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path. Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going. Search for survivors, or try to escape the city alone. Look after your mental health, or descend into madness. Lone Survivor is a game where your choices genuinely matter. This extended edition of Jasper Byrne's horror masterpiece expands Lone Survivor's deep story with hundreds of tiny new details, more locations, more dialogue, more side quests, more craftable items, and even two completely new endings. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut really is the ultimate version of this acclaimed game.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Set sail with Shantae and Risky Boots! Embark on a brand new adventure with Shantae, the hair-whipping belly dancing genie. When she loses her magic, Shantae must team up with her nemesis, the nefarious pirate Risky Boots in order to save Sequin Land from an evil curse. As a pirate, Shantae gains new weapons to advance her quest, slay monsters, battle epic bosses…and hopefully get her magic back in the bargain! But can she really trust her deadliest enemy? The third Shantae game is the biggest yet! Beyond Sequin Land lie cursed islands and labyrinths each hiding a new piece of Pirate Gear - Flintlock Pistol, Pirate Hat, Scimitar, Risky's Boots, and even a Cannon. Upgrade Shantae's hair and weapons or unlock advanced Fighter's Moves. Locate maps, return lost Heart Squids, collect rare loot, and laugh out loud at the weird, wild, and wonderfully humorous cast of characters. Incredible stereoscopic visuals, unlockable Pirate-Mode, multiple endings, and an unforgettable soundtrack make this one game you won't want to miss!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Get the goat! Toto Temple Deluxe is a fast-paced, local-multiplayer king-of-the-hill style game in which players must steal an egg-laying goat from their friends and try to keep it on their own head for as long as possible. You know, normal stuff. Infinitely dash in any direction to swiftly move around and powerfully headbutt the goat carrier to steal its four-legged booty. Escape your jealous opponents and protect the goat by blocking their attacks with a well-timed shield pop! You’ll &quot;get their goat&quot;, guaranteed. And don’t worry if you’re friendless. Bots will play with you whenever you want and for as long as you want. They never complain. They also never open up your fridge and ask if they can eat that pizza slice you got left from last night. Bots are awesome. Oh, and you can change their difficulty level too, because they will probably kick your astonishing little bottom.</synopsis>

Uncover the different courses life can take. Star Sky 2 is a personal experience, and a deeply atmospheric and meditative experience. Walk through the landscapes, interact with the environment and take notice as you go along. Explore the different roads presented and enjoy the sound and sights of the world. In Star Sky 2, Mårten Jonsson continues the story set by the previous one, with a similar style of gameplay. There are more choices and most importantly, more consequences. Learn from the choices you make, and see the different paths a life can take, and the scenarios that unfold. The game is a slow experience meant as a way to get lost in your thoughts, to feel the game as you are playing, and most importantly, to simply relax. Goodnight, and may you find what you're seeking beneath the stars.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Donkey Kong Country Returns offers the popular side-scrolling experience the series is known for, together with new levels, spectacular graphics and added depth to gameplay, courtesy of fully 3D environments – all of which are sure to delight both fans and series newcomers alike. Jump, race and roll your way across Donkey Kong Island on a quest to rescue DK’s beloved banana hoard from the trouble-causing Tiki Tak Tribe. Stomp on enemies, grab banana bunches and ride rockets, rhinos and much more in classic 2D platforming gameplay, stuffed full of spectacular scenes and tricky traps. Use both characters’ special skills to overcome all kinds of obstacles and explore each stage to the full – hop Diddy onto DK’s shoulders and use his Barrel Jet to hover them both over large gaps, or roll to your heart’s content and trample everything in your path. Take on the whole game together as the terrific twosome, DK and Diddy, by teaming up with a friend in the same room. Pelt opponents with Diddy’s Peanut Popgun and hover using his Barrel Jet, or slam bad guys into submission with Donkey Kong’s Ground Pound. The big guy can even do a Barrel Roll! Keep ‘em peeled for collectibles as you tear through the jungle, across beaches and beyond. Grab the letters that spell out K-O-N-G and nab puzzle pieces hidden in each stage to unlock extra content, like super-tough Trophy levels. Unlock and conquer every one of these special stages and a brand new surprise awaits!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. Grab a Wii Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step back into the ring with a modern update of the classic Punch-Out!! Little Mac is back! Everyone’s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins the best of the original Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagination of the series. Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cel-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the original Punch-Out!! games. The motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>A Classic Mario Adventure that Everyone Can Enjoy – at the Same Time

Developers at Nintendo have dreamed of creating a simultaneous multiplayer Super Mario Bros.™ game for decades. The Wii console finally makes that dream come true for everyone this holiday season.

Now players can navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time on the same level at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun.

With the multiplayer mode, the newest instalment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced Super Mario Bros. fun.

Features:
* New Super Mario Bros. Wii offers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.
* Mario™, Luigi™ and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies – or their fellow players.
* In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote™ controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform – and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.
* New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario’s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.
* At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.</synopsis>

Based on the breakthrough control system that debuted in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, these new Wii controls bring an entirely new level of immersion and freedom to these milestone games.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Metroid: Other M is reminiscent of 2-D side-scrollers, but players can switch the perspective into 3-D at any time as they explore the twisting passages of a derelict space station and delve deep into a cinematic, never-before-told story of bounty hunter Samus Aran's past.
This new approach uses a new control scheme in which players use the Wii Remote controller held sideways to battle enemies and navigate the expansive, gorgeous environments in classic Metroid fashion, then aim at the screen with the Wii Remote pointer to blast foes in first-person and hunt the world for clues and hidden passages. This Japanese version can be played in English or Japanese.</synopsis>

			<title>Metroid: Other M</title>
			<synopsis>For decades, Samus Aran has been known as one of the first female protagonists in video games, and one of the most enigmatic. Having traded her haunted past for the solitary life of a bounty hunter, Samus finally tells her own tale in this revealing, personal story of her failings, her flaws and ultimately her motivation. Metroid: Other M is an unprecedented collaboration that blends the slick, action-packed production of the world-renowned Team Ninja development team with the game design talents of the creators of the original Metroid. Metroid: Other M is a dramatic new direction for a legendary franchise and a bold new blend between cinematics, storytelling and the best in interactive entertainment. Metroid: Other M takes the best elements of 1st-person and 3rd-person gaming to create a seamless blend between gameplay, story-telling and dynamic cinematography, that feels like a movie the player can control. Players hold the Wii Remote controller sideways while navigating and battling in 3rd-person. However, at any moment, players can switch immediately to Wii Remote pointer controls to examine and explore the environments in 1st-person perspective. Metroid fans know more about Samus’ suits and weapons than they do about what drives her. That’s about to change. The story begins immediately following the events of Super Metroid, when a baby Metroid gave its life to protect Samus. With voice acting and a rich story, players learn the engaging backstory of Samus as she weaves through an action-packed adventure aboard the Battle Ship, a decommissioned space facility. As she hurtles into this new adventure, Samus will encounter her first mentor and Commanding Officer of the Galactic Federation, Adam Malkovich. The development of Metroid: Other M is an exciting collaboration between Nintendo’s Yoshio Sakamoto and Team Ninja. Sakamoto was the director of Super Metroid in 1994. Team Ninja is the renowned action developer of Ninja Gaiden. Metroid: Other M pairs Sakamoto’s expert level design and exploratory focus of the classic Metroid series with Team Ninja’s signature stylish, no-holds-barred action.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Sin and Punishment: Star Successor is a Rail Shooting game, developed by Treasure and published by Nintendo. The game can be controlled using one of four control methods: Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller (as well as the Classic Controller Pro) and the Nintendo GameCube Controller. Playing as either Isa or Kachi, the player traverses through on-rail levels, moving and shooting independently. Attacking enemies can either be shot at from afar, or melee attacked when they are close enough. Some missiles can be melee attacked to turn them against enemies. Getting successive enemy hits whilst remaining unscathed increases the score multiplier.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The story, heavily influenced by Norse mythology, paints Asgard gods Freyr and Freya cooperating with mortals in their war against a race of giants attacking a village to the north -- the first skirmish in what will ultimately escalate into Ragnarok itself.

- Point the Wiimote at the screen and slash (i.e. draw lines) to attack. The game's on the bloody side, and Freyr can hack arms and legs off enemies.

- Freyr is best with melee weapons while Freya is more of a sorceress. Between the two characters, you can wield over 300 different weapons, from swords and bows to warhammers and javelins.

- Reginleiv has a lot of huge enemies -- including a frost giant that towers 90 feet into the air.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Resident Evil 4 was originally released on Nintendo GameCube in 2005, and now Resident Evil 4 Wii edition gets you closer to the tense and thrilling action of survival horror. Leon S. Kennedy, formerly Raccoon City Police Department’s idealistic rookie cop, is now a U.S. agent with a top-secret mission to rescue the President’s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious organisation. Leon must begin his investigation with a trip to an undisclosed village in Europe, where he encounters a horde of unruly villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that perpetrated Ashley’s kidnapping. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who - or what - is behind everything. When situations get out of control, take aim using the Wii Remote, lining up your targets with precision and using motion-based gestures to dodge out of the way of life-threatening traps. Resident Evil 4 Wii edition also includes “Separate Ways”, a side story starring secret agent Ada Wong, revealing a different side of the story.</synopsis>

			<title>Zack and Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</title>
			<synopsis>Enter a world of puzzles and piracy in Wii adventure Zack and Wiki: Quest for Barbaros’ Treasure. Crafted exclusively for Wii by Capcom, this point-and-click puzzle-solving adventure will have you racking your brains as you guide budding pirate Zack and his sidekick Wiki the monkey through eye-popping levels in search of untold riches. As an apprentice pirate, Zack spends his days searching for a long lost treasure that is said to be buried on a mysterious island. One day, he stumbles across a talking skull that turns out to be part of the remains of legendary pirate Barbaros. The ghost of Barbaros promises to lead Zack to the island he seeks if the young pirate will lift the curse he has been placed under and bring him back to life by collecting treasure from chests scattered throughout seven dangerous locations. Instead of directly controlling Zack and Wiki’s movements, you use the Wii Remote to point at items or areas on screen and then press the A Button to lead them there. Interacting with items and characters the duo come across will help to solve the problems in your path as you try to reach the all-important treasure chests. Different items will require you to use the Wii Remote in different ways: you can rotate handles, push doors and play musical instruments just by moving the Wii Remote accordingly. With beautiful cartoon style graphics, a quirky storyline and a difficulty curve that will ease you in gently but ultimately stretch your puzzle solving abilities to the limit, Zack and Wiki: Quest for Barbaros’ Treasure is a game well worth discovering!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>In this follow-up to Mario Smash Football, you use the skill provided by the Wii Remote and Nunchuk Controller to win the ball, score unstoppable goals and take control of the goalkeeper to perform spectacular saves. Mario is joined by other famous Nintendo characters who take on the role of captain. Then select a host of popular team-mates to make up the rest of the team, before competing in one of the game's many modes. Anything goes in Mario Strikers Charged Football as you can utilise a variety of special techniques to clinch goals. Each captain has their own set of skills and Super Abilities as well as being able to perform special shots called MegaStrikes, where the ball splits into six and flies at the goal. The defending player must use the Wii Remote to aim at and shoot these balls out of the air before they concede a goal. You can also charge the ball with energy, making it more likely to find its target. Each of the stadiums in Mario Strikers Charged Football have various characteristics and contraptions, which you must learn to use to your advantage to truly dominate the pitch.</synopsis>

			<title>Wario Land: The Shake Dimension</title>
			<synopsis>Hit the treasure trail and embark on a rescue mission with a difference in Wario Land: The Shake Dimension. When the innocent Queen Merelda is captured, only a hero with determination, strength and courage will be able to rescue her. Enter Wario. He certainly has what it takes to save the day, but not because he cares about the fate of the queen – he’s only in it for the money! Legend has it that Queen Merelda’s captor, the ruthless pirate Shake King, is in possession of a wallet that comes with an infinite supply of cash. With his mind on the money, Wario sets out to free the lady in waiting and reap the rewards. Using the unique features of Wii and featuring stunning, cartoon-like graphics and animation, Wario Land: The Shake Dimension casts the larger-than-life Wario in a classic 2D-style platformer that spans contrasting continents crammed with adventure. Playing with the Wii Remote held sideways, you’ll be able to overcome enemies by using special moves that are activated with a simple shake or tilt. Take Wario’s Ground Punch, for example - a powerful move that can be activated just by shaking the Wii Remote up and down and used to stun every enemy on the screen whenever Wario’s Shake Meter is full. You’ll also be able to grab and hurl the bad guys, tilting the Wii Remote to determine which direction you want to launch them. There are plenty of other ways to use the Wii Remote, too – tilting it to control the many modes of transport Wario must use on his quest or shaking it to empty every last coin from the bags of loot scattered around. As you would expect with pirates on the scene, every level has its fair share of cash and treasure to pocket. The money you earn comes in useful when you visit the shop to buy maps, movie scenes and new items. Beyond the necessity to make it from start to finish, every level also includes certain challenges that must be completed to earn Wario a Star, such as finishing the stage within a certain time. With all kinds of secret passages to reveal, you’ll have your work cut out for you to discover each and every one of the Stars on offer.</synopsis>

			<title>Super Mario Galaxy</title>
			<synopsis>From the amazing diversity of galaxies to the incredible control scheme offered through the Wii Remote, Super Mario Galaxy takes the Mario action you know and love and transports it into a world of gravity-defying levels set amid the stars. Whether you’re a Mario master or playing one of his adventures for the first time, you’ll actively jump from planet to planet with the motion-sensing and pointing capabilities of the controller. Mario’s newest move – the spin move – is performed by giving the Wii Remote a quick shake. It’s the most versatile move in the game and can aide Mario in his many discoveries. Additionally, the Wii Remote’s pointer is used to collect Star Bits, which can be thrown at enemies to stun them. Another innovation involving the pointer is the new Co-Star Mode. In Co-Star Mode, a second player can manipulate the environment, helping the player who is controlling Mario by holding enemies in place and shooting Star Bits. The Co-Star can also help Mario perform special high jumps in coordination with the playing partner. On top of all this you’ll find stellar graphics and spot-on camera controls. The camera faithfully moves with Mario, keeping you in perfect position to help him face each galaxy’s challenge. The depth of field created by each galaxy’s unique surroundings makes for a visually stunning, atmospheric experience. This is the must-have Mario game, for fans and the uninitiated alike.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Become Mario as he traverses gravity-bending galaxies, traveling in and out of gravitational fields by blasting from planet to planet. Players experience dizzying perspective shifts as they run upside down through wild alien worlds that need to be seen to be believed. Whether you're surfing on a ray across an ocean in the clouds, rolling on a ball through a treacherous garden, or floating in a bubble over a poisonous swamp, there's no limit to the cosmic challenges you'll encounter!

Shake it! Controlling Mario is as simple as can be with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Move Mario with the Control Stick and shake the Wii Remote to perform a spin move or cue Ring Stars that launch you to and from planetary objects. You can even point at bits of stardust to collect them or latch onto Beam Stars to blaze a magnetic trail through the heavens.

Mario can run, tiptoe, jump, triple-jump, backflip, and long-jump, but what he'll do most is spin. By shaking the Wii Remote, players make Mario spin around with fists outstretched, allowing him to pummel enemies and cue Star Rings that launch him from planet to planet.

He can also find plenty of power-ups: A Bee Mushroom turns him into Bee Mario, allowing him to fly for short periods of time and cling to honeycombs. A Boo Mushroom turns him into Boo Mario, allowing him to float and turn invisible to pass through mesh gates.

He'll constantly collect bits of stardust—these can be fired at enemies using the B Button. A second player can even take on this role, using a second Wii Remote to stall enemies, fire stardust, or even sweep aside projectiles.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The entire nano cosmos is under threat from the deadly Nanostray virus and only one person can stop it… you! Shrink down to microscopic size and prepare to blast your way through millions of deadly enemies in Nano Assault Neo, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
Take control of a miniscule ship armed to the teeth with advanced weaponry, then traverse individual cells to wipe out any trace of the virus. Use the control sticks of the Wii U GamePad to move and shoot simultaneously – the Left Stick to manoeuvre your ship, the Right Stick to aim and fire. You can also use the Wii U GamePad touch screen to adjust the position of your ship’s satellites, altering the ferocity of your firepower in an instant.
The faster you wipe out the enemy cells, the more points you’ll score and the quicker you’ll be able to move onto the next stage. Watch out for heart-pounding races through bonus-filled tunnels along the way, as well as gigantic boss battles that'll take every ounce of skill to survive.
Play through a variety of game modes and pit your scores against the world with online leaderboards. You can play solo or co-operatively with a friend, with each person having their own screen. One player uses the GamePad screen while the other views the game on TV and controls the action with a Wii Remote and Nunchuk or Wii Classic Controller. And if the TV is in use, you transfer the single-player action to the GamePad screen and continue the fight to save mankind!
*Classic twin-stick shoot-'em-up excitement with a high-definition finish, spectacular neon visuals and a pounding techno soundtrack.
*Blast your way through millions of enemies, then take on massive bosses in the quest to destroy the Nanostray virus.
*Play alone or co-operatively with a friend, using both the TV and the Wii U GamePad screen to share the action.
*Switch to the Wii U GamePad screen in single-player and continue the fight, even when the main TV is in use.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Turn off your TV, get your friends and family together, sit in a circle around the Wii U GamePad and play Spin the Bottle: Bumpie’s Party. Look at each other, do silly challenges, have fun and get a little closer. Spin the Bottle: Bumpie's Party is a game for 2-8 players. You sit in a circle around the GamePad and spin a virtual bottle. Two players are randomly paired up each round to do a collaborative physical challenge. Use the Wii Remotes and each other to dance, spin, grab, jump, hide, pump, pass and squeeze. Collaborate with your friends and complete the most challenges to win Bumpie's Party! Spin the Bottle might be tongue-in-cheek, but don’t worry, kissing is not required.
*23 different collaborative physical mini games.
*Look at, touch and communicate with each other.
*Play anywhere; you are not limited by your TV.</synopsis>

			<title>Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition</title>
			<synopsis>After an explosion allows some of Gotham City’s most wicked villains to seize control of Blackgate Prison, Batman enters the fray to return order to the once-high security prison in a unique story set three months after the events of Batman: Arkham Origins. The Joker, Penguin and Black Mask have each carved up their own turf within the walls, and with several other strong enemies also haunting the halls, it’s going to be a long, dark night for the Caped Crusader in Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate – Deluxe Edition, available from Nintendo eShop on Wii U. The Dark Knight can grapple, glide, crouch and clamber around Blackgate Prison, surprising enemies with gadgets such as explosive gel or his trusty Batarang. Seek out hidden objects by switching into Detective Mode, and collect equipment to open up new routes and areas to explore. Players can take on the line-up of supervillains in any order that they choose, but beware – some foes will be tougher to defeat without certain tools strapped to your utility belt!
Free-flowing combat has been completely redesigned for the side-scrolling viewpoint, with enemies waiting in the wings before jumping into full-force fisticuffs. Batman can also take a more stealthy approach, lurking in dark corners before striking in silence or triggering a variety of hidden traps. Activate Predator Mode and you can even see exactly where enemies are looking – or how close you are to being detected. Explore Blackgate Prison in high definition, using the new isometric map and hint system to find your way around and track your objectives more easily than before. Choose to display the map on the Wii U GamePad, or continue the adventure even when the television isn't available with off-TV play.
*A unique storyline set three months after Batman: Arkham Origins, told through hand-drawn cut scenes with full voice acting.
*Explore Blackgate Prison in high definition using the new map and hint system.
*Experience the series’ fast, fluid combat from a 2D perspective.
*Navigate Blackgate Prison and take on villains in any order with Batman’s wide array of gadgets.</synopsis>

			<title>Chasing Aurora</title>
			<synopsis>Experience a game inspired by the dream of flight in Chasing Aurora for Wii U. Spread your wings and soar in this beautiful 2D aerial action title for up to five players, available only from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
Set amongst a breath-taking vector graphics version of the Alps, and with an original soundtrack to play along to, Chasing Aurora invites you to swoop into a world of unique pop-up book style environments and experience the Wii U console’s asymmetric multiplayer capabilities. As well as the single-player mode there are three different multiplayer modes, so there’s plenty of fun for all! You can take your pick of the flock with five characters to choose from – are you more of a falcon fan or a crane character?
Multiplayer takes advantage of the asymmetric gameplay allowed by the Wii U GamePad, as one person takes control of the GamePad while the rest play using a Wii Remote and Nunchuk each. In two of the multiplayer modes, you’ll become either the predator or the prey and swap roles depending on the mode and which controller you’re using…
In Hide &amp; Seek the player with the GamePad must hide from the other players who will try to steal the Aurora’s Gem they’re carrying – you’ll need precise movements and good timing to try to stay in the air. Or stay cool and freeze all of the other players in Freeze Tag as you use the GamePad to fly into them – the rest of the players need to co-operate and try to keep at least one bird unfrozen until the end of the round. Alternatively, Chase mode means it’s every bird for themselves as you all try to grab (and keep holding onto) Aurora’s Gem, while trying to be the last bird flying. Only one player can be left at the end!
Single-player mode is just as much of a hoot though – you can take part in a Trail  Challenge and attempt to fly through a course against the clock, while hitting targets and scoring yourself points to receive time bonuses. But when the timer reaches zero, it’s game over. Your adrenaline is sure to be pumping as you attempt to dodge environmental hazards like waterfalls or sudden gusts of wind!
Soar up high in Chasing Aurora for Wii U, the dream of flight has never been so uplifting!
*Experience a dream-like take on flight in a charming two-dimensional world, with five unique characters to choose from.
*Compete in three different multiplayer modes and a single-player challenge mode where you must race against the clock.
*Lightning storms, waterfalls and falling icicles – many challenges await you up in the air.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Every story has a beginning. But this one starts at the end. You just killed the last boss. Great. Now what? The only thing you remember is that you’ve lost your memory. Well, at least you’re still able to teleport yourself… a few meters. Is that it? Play the role of Kurt and discover a fun, old-school 2D platform game with a multiplayer mode. Explore over 40 levels as you try to recall your memories and look for the way back to… well... wherever it is you came from. A story told backwards, full of twists and surprises. More than 40 levels that will challenge even the most experienced players. A multiplayer mode in which you can help your friends... or make their lives miserable. Classic pixel-art aesthetics that will take you back to the golden age of video games. Welcome to Roving Rogue.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Available to download from Nintendo eShop, Pokémon Rumble U brings the fun of the Pokémon Rumble series to Wii U. Intuitive controls let you easily play through your quest solo or with friends. Pokémon Rumble U is the tale of the Toy Pokémon’s great adventure: after a mishap in the Toy Pokémon Shop, a few Pokémon capsules are swept down a river and washed up on a strange riverbank. Our heroes set out to find their way back to the Toy Pokémon Shop. Along the way they discover all is not right: can you help them discover why some of the Toy Pokémon are fighting each other, and what the enemy Pokémon are plotting? Up to four players can enjoy multiplayer battles, featuring co-operative play to defeat the strongest enemies with teamwork, or friendly competitions to see who can defeat and befriend the most Pokémon. Pokémon Rumble U features every last one of the 649 Pokémon that have been discovered as far as Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2, and hundreds of moves to master in battle. And the more Pokémon you defeat, the more Pokémon you can befriend, each with different strengths and weaknesses that will shape your battle strategy. Other surprises and pick-ups will crop up along the way – which will help strengthen the team, restore health, or cause damage to the opponents. Pikachu and friends will encounter Giant Bosses, and players can even use the Wii U GamePad to set off Touch Bombs when faced with many Pokémon in battle at once.

			<synopsis>Make a splash in Puddle, available from Nintendo eShop for Wii U! Guide each puddle to its destination in this physics-based puzzle game – just try not to lose too much liquid on the way!
Use the motion controls of the Wii U GamePad to tilt the environment to the left and right and move the fluid carefully towards your goal. Each type of fluid will be different and have its own, unique properties so make sure you understand each one in order to avoid the hazards that lie ahead. Move ahead cautiously and deliver your liquid lot safely past obstacles like fires, electric currents and carnivorous plants in 49 levels that have been specially remastered for Wii U.
Try to take into account how each type of fluid might react in each situation: things like temperature and gravity will affect water, oil or molten lava, so make sure you judge wisely! Tilting too quickly can see some droplets left behind, but move the controller too slowly and you might not be able to make certain jumps with your goo. Compare your scores in a worldwide Leaderboard, or enter the world competition and try to win as many Medals and Challenges as you can. Will you beat the best players from the Puddle Community?
Dive into Puddle now and protect your petite pool whilst enjoying the smooth motion controls of the Wii U GamePad. Liquid leisure awaits you on Wii U!
*Tilt the GamePad and guide your puddle to safety in 49 fiendish levels.
*Get to know your liquid and do your best to avoid hazards such as burning passageways, electric currents and carnivorous plants.

			<synopsis>Pure 2D blasting is what retro shooter, XType Plus, has in its gun sights, as it docks for download exclusively in Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
You’ll need a sturdy trigger finger to survive this vertical blaster, as you pilot an insignificant vessel against an infinite series of randomly-generated bosses, each more difficult than the last. It’s a simple mission: wipe out the enemy and don’t get hit. The action kicks off with a laidback feel but very soon ramps up to hardcore proportions, where dodging is the key to survival. Lose your three lives, and it’s lights out.
As you battle on, you’ll come under relentless enemy fire from hulking, organic-looking ships. And XType Plus relishes every single shot, as huge patterns of bullets descend on your ship, leaving the slimmest of spaces to squeeze through. One blessing is your tiny hit box – only a direct impact to the core will take you out, although you’ll still need fighter-pilot reflexes and the eyes of a hawk to stay alive.
Beyond the blasting, XType brings fresh content in a supercharged ‘Plus’ mode, exclusive to Wii U, pitting you against the clock, your lives exchanged for a countdown. Add in EMP bombs (electromagnetic pulse) and a larger enemy arsenal, and you’ve got tension on a plate.
Conquer that all-important high score for a badge of honour, then showboat with the best of them via the leaderboard system. Better yet, every high score you upload is accompanied by a video of your game, and other players will be able to watch your performance, good or bad! The upside is that you can also watch how the top ten players reach such lofty heights – they might just help your battle strategy in XType Plus, a lean, pared down and intense challenge for all Wii U shooter fans.
-Destroy an endless stream of bosses for the highest of high scores
-Blast against the clock in Plus Mode, new for Wii U
-Upload gameplay videos and check out other gamers’ victory runs</synopsis>

			<synopsis>A timed puzzle game that challenges players with speed and precision. Each play session is a race to gain as many points as possible. Mode 1 is a bit of a match game where lines of a same geometric shape or special shape must be made for points. In Mode 2 players search for a specific shape on the blocks shown. Finally, in Mode 3 blocks move upwards and must be tapped to gain points. The key is keeping an eye on the shapes as some appear more often but give less points. Keep an eye on the elusive moon and sun shapes!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Tengami is an atmospheric point and touch adventure game inside a Japanese pop-up book. It is a relaxing and meditative game in which players gently explore a beautiful paper world at their own pace. As players explore the world they come across puzzles and obstacles that are solved by flipping, folding, sliding and pulling parts of the pop-up book in the same way as you would interact with a physical pop-up book.
Key Facts.
*First game set inside an authentic pop-up book that uses the folding of pop-ups as its core game mechanic.
*All scenes in the game are constructed like an authentic pop-up book.
*All scenes in the game can be replicated in real life by just using paper, scissor and glue.
*Tengami uses a custom engine for its entirely folding world.
*Striking art style, inspired by traditional Japanese arts &amp; crafts. All in game textures are real 'Washi' (Japanese specialty paper).</synopsis>

			<title>Tengami</title>
			<synopsis>Tread a paper path along the folds of a pop-up book and become wrapped up in a captivating world of secrets in Tengami, a unique point-and-click adventure for Nintendo eShop on Wii U. Tengami inks its way through a mysterious story, set in a world of Japanese fairy tales. Filled with texture and colour, there are shrines, forests and mountains to explore, each an intricate construction in its own right, and a digital reflection of the real-world origami technique it’s created with. Opening under the boughs of a once-mighty cherry tree, you must seek an answer to the lone tree’s blight. Collect cherry blossoms as you go, and traverse environments, as puzzles unfurl and obstacles reveal themselves. Each can be solved or surmounted by using the Wii U GamePad and stylus to flip, fold, slide and pull parts of the world – tap to move to a spot, and watch for glowing areas to indicate the way forward. To start, it could be something as simple as pulling down folds to create a path. But later on, you’ll have to look deeper and uncover clues buried within the layers, cuts and creases of the book – within the very folds of the world – as the puzzles become more lateral. The picture is completed by a soothing soundtrack from composer David Wise, enhancing the experience with a deft touch. The antithesis of all-out action, Tengami weaves a serene thread of relaxation and harmony. It’s a perfect partner for night-time puzzle-solving, as relaxing as green tea. You won’t need any other reason to lose yourself in an atmosphere of tranquil mystery and such striking visual style – and thanks to a familiar world of pop-up books, you’ve known how to play it since your childhood.
*Explore a beautiful, hand-crafted pop-up book that tells a Japanese fairy tale.
*Use the GamePad to point-and-click through puzzles and unravel the mystery of a dying tree.
*A haunting, orchestral score from composer David Wise.
*Off-TV play lets you relax in a quiet space to enjoy the game in peace.</synopsis>

			<title>Teslagrad</title>
			<synopsis>Command electromagnetic forces as you puzzle your way through an ancient conspiracy in the steampunk-powered platformer, Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U. With no single word of text or dialogue throughout the entire game, Teslagrad keeps its cards very close to its chest: opening in a rain-soaked city, you are a small, nameless boy – a ‘Teslamancer’ – who can manipulate the twin forces of electricity and magnetism. As the last of your kind, explore the mysterious metropolis and, eventually, the Tesla Tower, to discover a terrible truth about a tyrannical king who once ruled the nation.
As you venture through this archaic, European-inspired world, dodging and drubbing its dangerous denizens, be prepared to flex your mental muscles – solve devious puzzles by using your powers to manipulate the environment, including switching the negative or positive charge of blocks and platforms to open up pathways, and reach new areas. Opposite polarity makes the targets attract, whereas similar polarity makes them repel. Give yourself a specific polarity to ride charged energy tubes, floating side-to-side, or circumventing crackling, electrical barriers designed to zap you! Polarise nearby critters, then send them off down small gullies and alcoves in order to affect otherwise-unreachable objects. By the time your reach the first of the hulking, industrial bosses, your electromagnetic prowess will be second nature! Keep pressing on, and pick up new items for more powers, such as a short-distance teleport to span greater gaps, then hunt down enigmatic scrolls that may hold the key to future events. With later puzzles reaching fiendish levels of difficulty, you’ll need to employ trial-and-error to successfully traverse the tower, especially as traps and creatures will do away with you in a single hit! Razor-sharp ingenuity and flawless logic are your sword and shield in this deep, mysterious place.
With over a hundred levels of retro, 2D platforming set in a non-linear world, plus Machiavellian puzzles galore, your mental and physical reflexes will be tested to capacity in Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
-Explore a strange, industrial tower through classic, 2D platforming action
-Use electromagnetic powers to move, float and teleport your way around enemies and obstacles
-Bend your brain by solving puzzles that eventually reveal an ancient secret</synopsis>

			<synopsis>GravBlocks+ is a new and different take on the traditional match-three style puzzle game. Rather than building combos the old fashioned way, the gameplay is designed around strategic planning and changing gravity and earn Score Multipliers. However, it's not as easy as it sounds! The walls are filled with Destruction Hazards, and dropping blocks into those Hazards instantly resets the Score Multiplier. Using a Wild Block closes the Hazards making gravity changes safer, but players need to plan well for these moments!</synopsis>

Then, instead of you, the meteors will hit the mutants when they crawl up from your insides.

			<title>Wii Street U</title>
			<synopsis>Pick up your Wii U GamePad and head out on a fascinating tour of the world with Wii Street U powered by Google. Take a trip down the road or hike the Grand Canyon, all without leaving your living room. Wii Street U powered by Google is available to download from Nintendo eShop for a limited time*.

Use the Wii U console’s unique controller, the Wii U GamePad, to give you a fresh perspective on the world. Simply type in a location and you'll be transported there – virtually, of course – with an overhead map on the TV giving everyone in the room a fascinating bird’s-eye view of the world. Then switch to Street View and use the Wii U GamePad’s 6.2-inch screen and intuitive motion controls to look around and explore the world.

If you can’t think of anywhere you’d like to visit, why not take a tour and check out some Recommended Tour Spots? These spectacular scenes from all over the world are just a few seconds away. You can even talk about your favourite spots with other users on Miiverse, and check out their suggestions too.

Update your software by starting it from the Wii U Menu while connected to the Internet, which will add the following features to make your globe-trotting experience even more exciting!

Automatically move along recommended routes, letting you take in the scenery while you move between spots. You can even search, bookmark and post your favourite routes, making it easier than ever to discover new sights around the world. And speaking of discovering new sights, use cryptic clues to seek out special characters hidden around the world. It's a global treasure hunt in the palm of your hand!

Step onto your Wii Balance Board and start walking around places all over the world. Walk on the spot to move forward, and shift your weight to change direction and explore the scene around you. As you take steps on the balance board, the screen will move up and down as though you're walking in real life, to help immerse you in the scene more than ever.

Write about your favourite spots on Miiverse, and post or view screenshots, from within Wii Street U powered by Google itself**. On top of bookmarking favourite routes, you can also create bookmarks for spots that you’ll want to come back to at the touch of a button, add Miiverse-supported tags to your bookmarks, see a location’s elevation, and even check which way is north using the on-screen compass! It’s even easier to explore on the ground because the handy Street View Guide (the line that shows all the paths you can follow) will turn a darker shade when you’ve already been somewhere.


Discontinuation of Wii Street U powered by Google

We sincerely thank you for your continued support of our company’s products and services.

			<synopsis>Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!
Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!
But, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>An evil enchantress. A kidnapped lover. A legion of enemies. What’s missing? A tiny knight wielding a huge spade, of course! Welcome to Shovel Knight, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
As the diminutive warrior sworn to uphold the code of Shovelry – slash mercilessly and dig tirelessly! – take command of your ShovelBlade to despatch  enemies in this retro, 2D adventure, complete with 8-bit visuals and a chiptune soundtrack.
You’ll face the The Order of No Quarter, eight nefarious knights responsible for taking your lost love. Hack and slash your way through the land; upgrade your weapons and armour by digging for treasure; and unearth relics to upgrade your shovelling skills.
As you progress, the world stages can be tackled in different orders. Defeat the last level and you’ll be able to exhume all the secrets of New Game Plus: play from the start with full upgrades but fewer resources and harder enemies. There’s even a Challenge Mode chock-full of mini games!
You’re not on your own, though: Miiverse Digger’s Diary is a mystical tome that allows you to read in-game messages from other players. Bust out your quill to warn people about traps with anything from a simple word to a sweet illustration. You can even rate other players’ messages with a ‘Yeah!’
Shovel Knight on Wii U is pixel-perfect platforming with a huge dollop of nostalgia. Now, pick up a shovel and get digging!
*Perfect your platform skills to save your beau!
*Revel in vintage 8-bit aesthetics from yesteryear!
*Read and write messages through Miiverse.</synopsis>

			<title>Toki Tori</title>
			<synopsis>Toki Tori is the first of three Two Tribes classics to arrive on Wii U eShop. Next up will be 3D puzzler RUSH and retro platformer EDGE.

While the classic gameplay has remained intact, Toki Tori has been adapted to make use of the Wii U Gamepad, allowing for off-TV play and optional touch controls.

The gameplay in Toki Tori is a blend of two genres. While it looks like a platform game, it's a puzzle game at heart. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg in a level using a set number of tools. Players will have to look and plan ahead carefully while using items such as the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock™. Additional tools are gradually introduced as the player progresses through the game's 80+ levels covering five unique worlds.
*Off-TV gameplay supported.
*Both touch screen and traditional controls.
*A wide variety of items and weapons.
*Over 80 levels spread over 5 worlds.
*For all ages - accessible and hard levels available.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Discover a unique hybrid of 2D shooting and 360-degree platforming action in Scram Kitty and his Buddy on Rails, exclusive to Nintendo eShop on Wii U. Months after the disappearance of your beloved Scram Kitty, you finally learn his fate – catnapped by a race of evil robot rodents aboard a huge, Earth-orbiting laboratory! It’s all the fault of the Council of Great Scientists: a recent experiment went south, creating the super-intelligent mice, hell-bent on colonising the planet. And now they’re running amok. Just who will save the day?!
You, of course! As Scram Kitty’s buddy, jump on your magnetic spinboard, ride the energy rail, and shoot those mice using any and all weapons at your disposal. It’s a top-down blast-a-thon, where wide-awake, 2D graphics meet modern 3D backgrounds. Rain down undiluted destruction via arcs of bullets, then perform a smash jump, a rather cool move which lets you leap from rail to rail, dodging bullets and pulverising enemies.
So, get your trigger finger ready and polish your reflexes. It’s the only way to put those mice on ice before they execute their dastardly plan!
*A top-down shooter mixing unique 360-degree gameplay with distinctive 2D and 3D graphics.
*Employ different strategies and tactics to save as many of the lost cats as you can.
*Blast to the beat of an original electro synth soundtrack.
*Go for broke in the one-credit-only Arcade Mode.</synopsis>

Once logged in you can select a game, and if it's a title that you've been playing the app will display your unlocked achievements and show the rewards that you can unlock. With 10 tokens for signing up and most games throwing some initial points your way, you're likely to be in a position to redeem them for some game content in no time. The goodies on offer range from wallpapers to additional game modes, meaning that it's probably worth saving up your winnings for more substantial content. With the app directly integrating with the games it recognises on the system, it should make the uPlay service intuitive and easy to use for Wii U gamers.</synopsis>

			<title>ZaciSa's Last Stand</title>
			<synopsis>Can you survive?
ZaciSa's Last Stand is a simple, yet challenging, 2D tower defense game set in space.
The main concept is that you have to defend your base from an onslaught of enemy ships that seek to destroy you and your way of life. To do this, you will deploy different Bot weapons, such as a Sentry or Bomber to destroy them before they get to your base. The game will start out easy enough, at least in theory, with only something small, like twenty weak enemies. Every level you survive will result in more enemies with increasing strength. You gain points and money for every ship you destroy, as well as a nice bonus at the end of each round. You use this money to not only build more Bots, but also different kind of upgrades. Featuring multiple maps to test your different strategies. Can you survive the slaughter?</synopsis>

Jim Hawkins, the world-renowned archaeologist, has gone missing while exploring the frozen reaches of Antarctica.

Before his disappearance, he entrusted his daughter Tina with a map to the long forgotten ruins of Ukampa Temple in South America, along with a letter warning that death waits behind its every corner.

In that letter, he posed a challenge to his estranged son, Aban Hawkins: to venture forth into the deadly ruins in search of a legendary treasure rumored to lie behind the Golden Door of Poko-Mum.

			<synopsis>One Adventurer. 1001 Lives. Can you do it?

Jim Hawkins, the world-renowned archaeologist, has gone missing while exploring the frozen reaches of Antarctica.

Before his disappearance, he entrusted his daughter Tina with a map to the long forgotten ruins of Ukampa Temple in South America, along with a letter warning that death waits behind its every corner.

In that letter, he posed a challenge to his estranged son, Aban Hawkins: to venture forth into the deadly ruins in search of a legendary treasure rumored to lie behind the Golden Door of Poko-Mum.

Can Aban survive the endless traps of Ukampa and surpass his famous father once and for all?</synopsis>

Then there is the evil parallel universe, and special 2D speed-run inspired worlds. Lots of unexpected deadly twists, and surprises await! The star of the game features a space armadillo named Armillo. He's not your usual armadillo as he's capable of blasting off to space in order to travel from planet to planet. He's joined by his little blue critter friends and his brother. What's supposed to be a peaceful galaxy becomes ruined by the invasion of the robotic Darkbots. Where are they from? Why are they here? But one thing is for sure, they certainly are not the friendly type.</synopsis>

Flying from planet to planet, help Armillo rescue them and take back his home: a series of spherical 3D worlds featuring all manner of obstacles and enemies.

You’ll need lightning reflexes and your best, old-school platforming skills in these special stages – especially as you’re pushed to beat each stage against the clock.

			<synopsis>It can’t be much fun to discover you’ve got a ‘pink spaghetti arm’ sticking out of your head, but that’s the hand Ray Wood’s been dealt in crazy platform puzzler Stick it to the Man, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
After being bashed on the bonce by a mysterious object, Ray wakes up in hospital, only to discover a new appendage attached to his brain. Better – or should that be worse? – yet, he’s able to read minds. And that may be his only out, as he finds himself framed for his girlfriend’s murder, surrounded by shadowy thugs, and most definitely on the run from ‘The Man’. Inhabiting a platforming world made from paper and stickers, Ray is able to fold and tear the structures around him, and his spaghetti arm is handy when it comes to clasping platforms or swinging from push-pins. Better yet, he can peel stickers from the world around him and attach them to objects and people to solve puzzles: if a disgruntled goon is blocking your way, slap a friendly dog’s mouth on his face to improve his mood so he lets you pass! It’s a puzzling world, and no mistake… Ray can also learn people’s motives with his new-found telepathy. Pick up the Wii U GamePad, and it’ll switch to mind-reading mode – hold it up to your TV and search for characters, then zoom in on their brains to read their thoughts or straight-up pluck them from their heads! It’s an appealing skill that’ll help Ray escape sticky situations, as he tries to evade the host of crazies that populate this outlandish, aberrant town. When you’re not picking peoples’ brains, you can also find your way around with a helpful map on the GamePad – or you can play off-TV altogether! With a curious eye on retro run-and-jump action, Stick It To The Man contains an insane amount of humour that constantly threatens to tear the very folds of its world. Is Ray cut out for life on the lam? Can he escape the bind he’s in? Will he ever discover why The Man wants him pulped? There’s only one way to find out – get stuck in!
*Meet colourful, crazy characters when you go on the run in an old-school, platforming world.
*Use your pink spaghetti arm to fold the world, attach stickers, and escape &quot;The Man.&quot;
*Read characters’ minds by sweeping your TV screen with the Wii U GamePad.</synopsis>

			<title>Stick it to the Man</title>
			<synopsis>It can’t be much fun to discover you’ve got a ‘pink spaghetti arm’ sticking out of your head, but that’s the hand Ray Wood’s been dealt in crazy platform puzzler Stick it to the Man, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
After being bashed on the bonce by a mysterious object, Ray wakes up in hospital, only to discover a new appendage attached to his brain. Better – or should that be worse? – yet, he’s able to read minds. And that may be his only out, as he finds himself framed for his girlfriend’s murder, surrounded by shadowy thugs, and most definitely on the run from ‘The Man’. Inhabiting a platforming world made from paper and stickers, Ray is able to fold and tear the structures around him, and his spaghetti arm is handy when it comes to clasping platforms or swinging from push-pins. Better yet, he can peel stickers from the world around him and attach them to objects and people to solve puzzles: if a disgruntled goon is blocking your way, slap a friendly dog’s mouth on his face to improve his mood so he lets you pass! It’s a puzzling world, and no mistake… Ray can also learn people’s motives with his new-found telepathy. Pick up the Wii U GamePad, and it’ll switch to mind-reading mode – hold it up to your TV and search for characters, then zoom in on their brains to read their thoughts or straight-up pluck them from their heads!

			<synopsis>Say ‘Ahoy!’ to the banana-loving Monkey Pirates, as they set sail on a multiplayer battle royale, available to download from Nintendo eShop for Wii U.
Taking command of one of four Captain Monkeys, aim your cannons at up to three of your friends, while racing against the clock to collect as many bananas as possible. A free-for-all, four-way frenzy is busy enough but when a fifth player joins the fray as the Sea king, it adds an interesting twist: using the Wii U GamePad, they have a set of ‘Deeds’ to achieve – get a certain player into the lead, for instance – and can unleash bonuses and events to make it happen. You should expect the unexpected, and can bank on multiplayer mayhem!
Although cannons do enough damage on their own, it’s the range of bonuses that’ll really get you ahead. Across nine arenas, you can choose which items to bash your friends with, from broadsides to mines to battering rams. But it’s not all offensive stuff – some bonuses will mean pop-up environmental hazards, forcing everyone to dodge events such as maelstroms, volcanoes and icebergs. There’s no such thing as a calm ocean in Monkey Pirates!
Then there’s the weather. You’ll need to be an accomplished captain, as there are some strong winds to navigate. Keep your aim true, brake in the face of danger, and even skid across the waves. Shrewd manoeuvres are definitely the key to survival. Zip between criss-crossing cannonballs, then line up a fellow swashbuckler for a direct hit, sinking them down to Davy Jones’ locker! Life on the ocean waves has never been this entertaining!
*Up to five buccaneers can play in a frenzy of crazy multiplayer monkey action!
*A fifth player can use the Wii U GamePad to complete Deeds and affect battle as the Sea King.
*Boatloads of bonuses to bolster your big guns and boost your booty!</synopsis>

			<title>Mappy</title>
			<synopsis>The player guides Mappy the police mouse through the mansion of the cats called the Mewkies to retrieve stolen goods. The player uses a left-right joystick to move Mappy and a single button to operate doors. The mansion has six floors, four or five in some other versions, of hallways in which the stolen items are stashed. Mappy and the cats move between floors by bouncing on trampolines at various places in the house. Both Mappy and the cats can land on a floor on the way up, but not on the way down. When they pass in the air, Mappy is unharmed by the cats, but if Mappy runs into a cat anywhere else, he will lose a life. The trampolines will break if Mappy bounces on them four times in a row. The trampolines change color depending on how many times Mappy has used them without a rest. In addition to the Mewkies, the boss cat Nyamco also roams around. He is faster, but less aggressive than the Mewkies. Throughout the levels, Nyamco hides behind the different recoverable objects. If Mappy recovers an item which Nyamco is hiding behind, the player receives bonus points. A round is completed when all the loot is retrieved. If Mappy tarries too long, a &quot;Hurry&quot; message appears after which the music and the cats speed up, and more Mewkies are added (two will appear ready to drop as the Mewkies normally do immediately following the &quot;hurry&quot; message, and more Mewkies can arrive later on). If the player waits too long after this, the &quot;Gosenzo&quot; coin (a green disk shape with Nyamco's face on it) will drop onto the top-middle platform and chase Mappy in a manner similar to the Mewkies, but more effectively. The &quot;Gosenzo&quot; coin can kill Mappy even if he is in the air. The third round and every fourth round after that is a bonus round. Mappy, unbothered by the cats, must bounce across a series of trampolines, popping fifteen different suspended red balloons, with a &quot;Nyamco&quot; along the way. A bonus is awarded if all the balloons are popped before the music ends. After every bonus round, a new feature is added to the gameplay, such as bells that freeze cats. The &quot;Hurry&quot; message will also appear sooner. There are 256 levels.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Available now, play one of the greatest Super Mario Bros. games of all time. Available on Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Relive the classic that brought renowned power-ups such as the Tanooki Suit to the world of Super Mario Bros.! Bowser™ and the Koopalings are causing chaos yet again, but this time they’re going beyond the Mushroom Kingdom into the seven worlds that neighbor it. Now Mario™ and Luigi™ must battle a variety of enemies, including a Koopaling in each unique and distinctive world, on their way to ultimately taking on Bowser himself. Lucky for the brothers, they have more power-ups available than ever before. Fly above the action using the Super Leaf, swim faster by donning the Frog Suit, or defeat enemies using the Hammer Bros. Suit. Use the brand-new overworld map to take the chance to play a minigame in hopes of gaining extra lives or to find a Toad’s House where you can pick up additional items. All this (and more) combines into one of gaming’s most well-known and beloved titles—are you ready to experience gaming bliss?</synopsis>

They chip away at the blocks overhead, then jump up through the resulting hole to the mountain's next level. Once Popo reaches the top level, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up veggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff. Of course, not everyone's supportive of Popo's pastime. Toppies fill Popo's holes, so players must jump through the gaps quickly.

			<synopsis>Delve into the land of dreams-turned-nightmares as Kirby flies with the stars! Not everything is well in Dream Land. For some mysterious reason, the Dream Spring, a magical well that is the reservoir for all the dreams of the citizens of Dream Land, is no longer working. Everyone is being subjected to their worst nightmares every time they go to sleep. Upon reaching the Dream Spring, Kirby finds out that evil King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, thus depriving Dream Land of the magical energy that feeds its spring. Using 20 unique tricks and your ability to steal your enemies' powers by swallowing them, you'll have to make your way through a horrific land filled with all kinds of nightmares. Recover the broken pieces of the Star Rod, and everyone in Dream Land will sleep peacefully once again. If you fail, the citizens of Dream Land will be subjected to a lifetime of terrible nightmares.</synopsis>

The gameplay is simple yet challenging: eliminate all the enemies in each level for a big score. However, Mario cannot jump on enemies from above so must hit them from below and finish them off with a kick. Add a second player as Luigi for even more fun!</synopsis>

			<title>Balloon Fight</title>
			<synopsis>You'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky!
Maneuvering an airborne character to pop your opponents’ balloons before they pop yours sounds easy, but don’t be fooled by this game’s simple premise or cute visuals. Underneath these elements you’ll find a surprisingly challenging game with strategy to spare. After mastering the easy-to-learn controls, you'll still have to get a grip on the game’s impressively realistic physics as you to face ever-increasing enemies and environmental hazards like lightning and water. Take a break from the action and play the game’s second mode, Balloon Trip, to see how long you can stay aloft.
Balloon Fight will be available for purchase in the Nintendo eShop in the future. Please check back for updates
Wii U owners who have purchased this game during the Famicon 30th Anniversary promotion will not need to purchase it again at the regular price.</synopsis>

			<title>Punch-Out!!</title>
			<synopsis>Spar against unique opponents -- old and new -- and outwit their unique techniques! Featuring the tight game play and humor the series is known for, this sequel to the NES classic sees Little Mac return to the ring with the World Video Boxing Association belt once again at stake. Slug your way through the grueling, sweat-pounding matches of the Minor, Major, and World Circuits as you face off against some of Little Mac’s greatest rivals like Bear Hugger, Bald Bull, and Super Macho Man. With a cast of new challengers waiting, do you have what it takes to identify their unique patterns and exploit their weaknesses? Go to your corner and come out fighting, but remember what Doc Louis would say, &quot;It’s not about brawling—it’s about finesse!&quot;</synopsis>

			<title>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</title>
			<synopsis>Help Simon Belmont in his gruesome quest and end his plight! In this one-player adventure you once again take on the role of Simon Belmont and duel to the death with Count Dracula. Grab your legendary whip, Vampire Killer, and roam freely through Transylvania on a quest to find the count’s missing body parts. These are the key to breaking an evil curse put upon Simon by the count. This quest won't be easy, though, for you must battle hideous fiends who stalk the land. In addition to the intense action and tight control the Castlevania series is known for, this sequel also introduced several unique game-play elements into the fold. Build experience the longer you play, buy weapons and items from merchants, or talk with villagers to get clues (some of which are false!). Watch as day turns to night and then back again. Take a deep breath, steady your nerves, and help Simon end his curse and defeat the count once and for all.</synopsis>

			<title>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</title>
			<synopsis>Help Simon Belmont in his gruesome quest and end his plight! In this one-player adventure you once again take on the role of Simon Belmont and duel to the death with Count Dracula. Grab your legendary whip, Vampire Killer, and roam freely through Transylvania on a quest to find the count’s missing body parts. These are the key to breaking an evil curse put upon Simon by the count. This quest won't be easy, though, for you must battle hideous fiends who stalk the land. In addition to the intense action and tight control the Castlevania series is known for, this sequel also introduced several unique game-play elements into the fold. Build experience the longer you play, buy weapons and items from merchants, or talk with villagers to get clues (some of which are false!). Watch as day turns to night and then back again. Take a deep breath, steady your nerves, and help Simon end his curse and defeat the count once and for all.</synopsis>

The greedy Sea Urchins have stolen all of Clu Clu Land’s gold bars and buried them in a series of mazes. As Bubbles, a brave bubble fish, you’ll set out to uncover all of the gold bars in each maze. But you’ll have to be careful: Sea Urchins will relentlessly pursue Bubbles, and there are also dangerous black holes that must be avoided.

			<title>Donkey Kong 3</title>
			<synopsis>Based on the third game in the enormously popular arcade series, Donkey Kong 3 introduces an exterminator named Stanley as he desperately tries to protect the flowers in his greenhouse from Donkey Kong. Armed only with a can of bug spray, Stanley must force Donkey Kong higher and higher into the greenhouse rafters until Donkey Kong is off the screen and the next stage is reached. But not surprisingly, Donkey Kong isn’t going to move without a fight, so he sends wave after wave of bugs, bees, and other creatures toward Stanley. Not only must Stanley repel the insects in order to save the flowers, but he’ll have to keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by Donkey Kong himself. If Stanley is good enough, he’ll be able to grab a can of more powerful bug spray and really get Donkey Kong moving. It all adds up to frantic fun that anyone can enjoy!</synopsis>

			<title>Bubble Bobble</title>
			<synopsis>BUBBLE BOBBLE's release in 1986 introduced the two bubble dragons, Bub and Bob, and brand new play mechanics, with players defeating enemies by trapping them in bubbles and then popping them. Although the puzzle-action game can be beaten by clearing all 100 rounds, it also contains secret elements such as not being able to get the &quot;true ending&quot; in single-player mode; hidden commands that lead to secret rounds; and a ton of different items. These elements are some of the game's most memorable and important features. Each round even has different air currents that are not visible, so bubbles rise in unpredictable patterns. Aspects like forcing players to understand and utilize these different patterns while playing help make this a revolutionary game that is fun to play anytime.</synopsis>

Select one of twelve teams, set your lineup from the 30 players available (each with different strengths), and then play a single game or try to win the pennant. During game play, the screen shows two different viewpoints: one from behind home plate as you’re batting, and the other from the pitching mound in a television-style shot (unique for the time) as your team plays in the field. Strong play control and excellent graphics add to the excitement as you decide what pitch to throw (you can even try to provoke the opposing batter into charging the mound!), control all of the positions in the field, or do your best to get a hit. So step to the plate and find out why this is one of the most popular baseball games on the NES. Can you pull through in the clutch?</synopsis>

			<title>Antarctic Adventure</title>
			<synopsis>The player takes the role of an Antarctic penguin, racing to disparate research stations owned by different countries in Antarctica (excluding the USSR). The gameplay is similar to Sega's Turbo, but plays at a much slower pace, and features platform game elements. The penguin, later named Penta, must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding sea lions and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending – when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty.</synopsis>

Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups, such as money bags, Mighty Coins, and Mighty Drinks, usually hidden in treasure chests. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors, and Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. However, be careful to not get greedy with collecting many too Mighty Coins or Mighty Drinks. Otherwise, you'll find yourself doing jumping jacks in the Torture Room!</synopsis>

			<title>Fire Emblem Gaiden</title>
			<synopsis>Fire Emblem Gaiden is a tactical role-playing game set on the continent of Valentia. Players take the role of childhood friends Alm and Celica, navigating an overworld and having the ability to visit towns where characters can buy items from vendors, such as health potions and weapons: vendors also enable the swapping of items and weapons between playable units. The overworld is freely navigable, with further areas opening up as the story progresses. The game features two difficulty levels: &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot;. On Easy mode, experience points earned through actions in combat are increased, and items can be exchanged between units beyond vendor stalls. Battles use a turn-based battle system, with player and enemy units each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player defeating key enemy units such as commanders and other boss characters. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given a limited number of units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also effects their range of movement on the battlefield.[4][6] In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set, but can promote once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess.[4][5] Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase randomly. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.</synopsis>

			<title>Battle City</title>
			<synopsis>The player, controlling a tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle, or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy Tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives. Battle City contains 35 different stages that are 13 units wide by 13 units high. Each map contains different types of terrain and obstacles. Examples include brick walls that can be destroyed by having either the player's Tank or an enemy Tank shoot at them, steel walls that can be destroyed by the player if he has collected three or more power-up stars, bushes that hide Tanks under them, ice fields that make it difficult to control Tank and pools of water which cannot be crossed by Tanks. There are four progressively harder types of enemy Tanks. The game becomes more challenging in later levels, as enemy Tanks may act as decoys to lure players away from their base so that another Tank can destroy it. In addition, flashing Tanks could be destroyed for power-ups. There are several types of power-ups: Tank symbol gives an extra life, star improves player's Tank (having one star make shots faster, having two stars allow two simultaneous shots, having three stars allow the player to destroy steel), bomb destroys all visible enemy Tanks, clock freezes all enemy Tanks for a period of time, shovel adds steel walls around the Phoenix for a period of time and shield makes player's Tank invulnerable to attack for a period of time. Battle City was one of the earlier games to allow two players to play simultaneously. Both players have to defend the base together, and if one player shoots the other, the friendly fire victim would be unable to move for a while (but can still shoot). It was also one of the first NES games to allow players access to an edit mode where they could create custom levels, though these custom levels cannot be saved unlike in similar modes such as the one in Excitebike.</synopsis>

			<title>Princess Tomato And The Salad Kingdom</title>
			<synopsis>Taking the role of Sir Cucumber, a knight, the player is assigned by King Broccoli (now deceased) to defeat the evil Minister Pumpkin who has kidnapped Princess Tomato. Early on, Sir Cucumber gains a sidekick, Percy the baby persimmon, who offers advice and helps throughout the quest (and always calls Sir Cucumber &quot;Boss&quot;). Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom plays similarly to a text adventure, though due to the NES's lack of a keyboard accessory, the possible commands are represented by buttons which line both sides of the screen. The commands are fixed and do not change during gameplay. Primarily, the game consists of still screens with the exception of the &quot;finger wars&quot; (rock, paper, scissors), mazes and occasional animated character, such as the octoberry and fern birds. Players can issue commands to the game's protagonist. The only way to &quot;lose&quot; is by not being able to determine which action is required to advance or by failing to defeat end-game boss, Minister Pumpkin, in a game of &quot;finger wars&quot;.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Retirement has never been so short lived for this fighter. It has been 25 years since Ken left the glory days of his fighting career. Since then, he has been working with his friend Troy to create &quot;Cyboplasm&quot;–an innovative formula that can turn ordinary humans into superbeings of incredible strength. But one day, Ken arrives at their lab to find the formula stolen and a pile of jelly where he should have found Troy... Navigate across the galaxy as Ken follows the trail of his friend's murderer. Jump, climb, and fight your way past monstrous enemies as you complete the objective for each stage. Just like in his days in the Street Fighter world, Ken can punch and kick his way through danger, but he can also fire power shots from a distance. Will Ken be able to find justice at the end of his journey?</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Billy and Jimmy face their toughest challenge yet as they must save Marian from an evil organization in pursuit of the legendary Rosetta Stones. Like other games in the Double Dragon series, you can play through this perilous journey by yourself or with a friend in multiplayer. The NES version of Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones is different from the arcade version and introduces an innovative feature: the player can recruit two bosses as allies and switch between characters at any time.</synopsis>

Once every hundred years, the powers of good mysteriously weaken, and evil attempts to resurrect Dracula. It's up to the Belmont clan to take up the eternal fight against the vampire. Players take on the role of Simon Belmont, armed with the legendary whip, Vampire Killer, to defeat Dracula and his evil minions. Luckily, Simon has many additional weapons at his disposal, including axes, holy water, crosses, knives and even a magical stopwatch that can stop the flow of time for a spell. Simon must travel through 11 stages, beginning in the countryside, to reach Dracula's Castle, all the while overcoming perilous traps and hideous monsters. Only the power of the Belmonts can quell the looming darkness.</synopsis>

When they stumble upon Yoshi™, a young dinosaur, Mario™ and Luigi™ learn that Bowser™ is responsible for the terrible misdeeds. Now, Yoshis are trapped in magical eggs that Bowser has hidden throughout seven castles. Many hidden paths aid Mario in making his way to Bowser's castle, completing 74 areas, and finding all 96 exits. Discover items, including a feather that gives Mario a cape that allows him to fly and a flower that lets him shoot fireballs, in layers upon layers of 2-D scrolling landscapes.

			<synopsis>Kaptain K. Rool and his cutthroat Kremlings have kidnapped Donkey Kong and are holding him ransom at Crocodile Isle for the banana hoard! Who will brave the seas to save our hairy hero?

Enter Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong, and they're ready to head out and show their stuff!

			<title>Super Mario Kart</title>
			<synopsis>Get-in, sit-down, and buckle-up to experience frantic kart racing with the game that started it all. Select one of eight characters from the Mario™ series—offering a variety of driving styles—and take on three championship cups in three different kart classes. Win enough, and you’ll unlock a fourth circuit: the ultra-tough Special Cup. Crossing the finish line in first place isn’t an easy task, though, as each track has unique obstacles to conquer and racers can obtain special power-ups that boost them to victory. For a different kind of challenge, take on a friend in multiplayer races or go head-to-head in the Battle Mode arena of your choosing, where the object is to pop your opponent’s balloons before you lose your own. With more than 15 tracks to master and nearly endless replay value, Super Mario Kart is classic gaming…with some banana peels thrown in for good measure!</synopsis>

Always armed with his trusty ability to swallow enemies and gain special attacks, Kirby can also unite with some of his animal friends and make use of their particular talents. Featuring detailed graphics, challenging boss battles, and the distinct charm of a Kirby game, it's no wonder this title is considered a classic.</synopsis>

Each Picross puzzle consists of a numbered grid of tiles which reveal a picture when correctly chiselled away. In Mario’s main mode, a wrong move means losing time. However, in the more difficult Wario mode, mistakes are not shown... so be careful! Also, a friend can help by joining in with a second controller.Please note: Mario's Super Picross is in Japanese only.</synopsis>

With a cast of new challengers waiting, do you have what it takes to identify their unique patterns and exploit their weaknesses? Go to your corner and come out fighting, but remember what Doc Louis would say, &quot;It’s not about brawling—it’s about finesse!&quot;</synopsis>

			<title>Super Famicom Wars</title>
			<synopsis>Players take control of one of two warring nations, Red Star and Blue Moon, as they seek to establish turn-based dominance over each other. After selecting which stage to start the game and setting which, if either, player will be controlled by a person, the Red Star army is given the first turn. The objective in each stage is to either conquer the enemy's headquarters or destroy all remaining enemy units in one turn. During each turn, the player is given a certain amount of funds which can be used to build units in factories, seaports, and airports in their command, as well as cities near their headquarters. Each unit has their own specialty and abilities, with ten land units (including two foot soldier units), four air units, and two sea units. Some units use firepower against the enemy, while others provide support to allies. Only foot soldier units are capable of conquering cities, which are used to repair or refuel damaged units and gain more funds. There are 15 maps available at the start of the game, with two secret ending maps dependent on the player's nation when playing against the computer.</synopsis>

			<title>Clock Tower</title>
			<synopsis>Clock Tower is a 2D psychological horror point-and-click style game, where the player controls a cursor to direct the main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. The interface is akin to computer adventure games of the 1990s, but simplified to work better with a gamepad. Primarily, the player can only move Jennifer left and right through the environment, although there are some rooms in which an action requires Jennifer to step into the background. Clock Tower is unique among adventure games of the era in that it features a stalker pursuing the main character. This delays puzzle solving and requires the player to run in order to find objects or hiding places to fend off or avoid the attacker. The stalker is a 9-year-old slasher named Bobby Barrows/Scissorman, who wields a large pair of scissors. If directly confronted by Bobby, the player engages in a &quot;panic&quot; phase and must repeatedly pound the &quot;panic button&quot; to attack the enemy. If Jennifer is low on health, or the player does not tap the panic button fast enough, Bobby will attack Jennifer and the player will be presented with a &quot;Dead End&quot; screen. Although the game refers to it as Jennifer's health, the color of the background where her face is shown changes to represent her current fear level. Blue means she is in a calm state, while yellow means she is startled, orange means she is alarmed, and finally red means she will begin to panic. In the red state, she is more likely to be attacked during a direct confrontation with Bobby. Additionally, while running away from Bobby, there is a chance she might trip over, making her vulnerable if Bobby is close by. Many of Bobby’s appearances are triggered by the player inspecting certain objects, but there are some cases in which he will come out of a hiding place and chase Jennifer as soon as she enters a room.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The dark knight Cecil, stripped of his command of the Red Wings, set out for the distant Valley of Mist. Together with Kain, commander of the Dragoons, he would pursue a faceless quarry―and a chance for redemption. The advent of the airship had marked the realization of mankind's most ancient dream. But man is a creature seldom sated, and he was quick to dream anew. With the unparalleled might of the Red Wings, Baron's military soon reigned supreme. Why, then, does its king now seek the Crystals? And why have fearsome monsters suddenly begun to overrun the once calm land? If the Crystals know, they share no answers―only their pure and silent light.</synopsis>

			<title>Pac-Attack</title>
			<synopsis>Pac-Man makes a rare appearance outside of a maze environment in Pac-Attack, a fun and quirky puzzle game! This unique entry in the genre puts its own twist on established conventions and adds one of gaming’s most iconic characters to the mix. The goal is simple: keep your screen clear of falling blocks and ghosts. You can clear blocks by lining them up horizontally, causing them to disappear. Clearing the ghosts, though, requires the help of a hungry Pac-Man (who just happens to swing by every so often for a snack). It’s up to you to get all of the ghosts lined up for him, because Pac-Man will keep eating them until he is stopped by a block or he runs out of ghosts. In addition, his range of movement on the playing field is limited to horizontal or downward—thus adding further strategy. There are three game modes to choose from: 1P Normal, 2P Versus, and the challenging 1P Puzzle.</synopsis>

			<title>Cosmo Gang the Puzzle</title>
			<synopsis>The players must stack the falling Jammers from the original game (or a new type of Cosmo Gangers called &quot;Pipopapo-Tai&quot;[1]) and Containers into groups by using their joysticks to move pieces left, right and down and pressing their buttons to rotate them; when a player fills a line of Containers, they will disappear. When a ball appears, note which direction the arrow on it is facing, as it will move in that direction when it drops - and it shall eliminate any Cosmo Gangers it hits on its way down to the bottom of the screen. If a player has chosen to start the game on &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Hard&quot; or &quot;Expert&quot; difficulty level, their &quot;Star Meter&quot; will fill up every time a ball eliminates a Cosmo Ganger; once it's completely filled, a Star will fall down from the top of the screen and eliminate seven rows of Cosmo Gangers when it lands. The two-player mode can, like The Return of Ishtar, all six of the World Stadium games, its predecessor, and F/A, be played with one credit - and in that mode, not only will eliminating a lot of the Cosmo Gangers at once result in a higher score but it can also cause a group of the eliminating player's Cosmo Gangers to fall down on his opponent's side of the screen. As with other falling puzzle games, the game will be over once the pieces reach the top of the screen; this is also the first game from Namco to not have an ending since Dig Dug II in 1985, which means that the closest a player can get to winning it is by getting 9,999,999 points, eliminating 9,999 Cosmo Gangers, clearing 9,999 lines, reaching level 999, or (for two-player mode) winning 99 times.</synopsis>

			<title>Pac-Attack</title>
			<synopsis>Pac-Man makes a rare appearance outside of a maze environment in Pac-Attack, a fun and quirky puzzle game! This unique entry in the genre puts its own twist on established conventions and adds one of gaming’s most iconic characters to the mix. The goal is simple: keep your screen clear of falling blocks and ghosts. You can clear blocks by lining them up horizontally, causing them to disappear. Clearing the ghosts, though, requires the help of a hungry Pac-Man (who just happens to swing by every so often for a snack). It’s up to you to get all of the ghosts lined up for him, because Pac-Man will keep eating them until he is stopped by a block or he runs out of ghosts. In addition, his range of movement on the playing field is limited to horizontal or downward—thus adding further strategy. There are three game modes to choose from: 1P Normal, 2P Versus, and the challenging 1P Puzzle.</synopsis>

The only ones who can stop them are Clint, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter, and Annie, a beautiful but deadly woman with a serious score to settle. Blast your way through villainous outlaws, diabolical robots, and towering, screen-filling bosses either by yourself or with a friend at your side in the two-player co-op mode. You'll need a sharp eye and quick-on-the-draw reflexes, but fortunately, you've got plenty of moves to help you survive the hail of bullets heading your way. You can dive-roll, jump, double jump, rope enemies with a lasso, and clear the screen with explosive special attacks. Blast apart just about everything in the environment to find guns, bombs, and other hidden power-ups. It's up to you to bring justice back to town—or whatever's left of it when the gun smoke clears.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Defeat the Dark Dragons, and bring back light to the world! In a distant land, peace was maintained for thousands of years by the powerful Dragon Clan. One day, the goddess Tyr appeared to them and offered to fulfill their every wish. Greed split the clans into the Dark Dragons and the Light Dragons, who battled to win Tyr's magic as she watched and encouraged their war. A warrior emerged from the Light Dragons, and with his seven companions, he sealed the goddess into another realm. Centuries have passed, and the Dark Dragons are destroying villages in search of the goddess keys to release Tyr from her prison. A new warrior must arise to face this latest blight! Join Ryu as he embarks on an adventure of a lifetime! He will need to rely on his companions if he is to rediscover the lost powers of the Light Dragons and save his sister, Sara, from the evil clutches of the Dark Dragons. Fight, and prove that the Warrior of the Dragon is not just a myth!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Collect the six elemental stones, and gain the power to conquer all realms! The Demon’s Crest consists of six magical stones that when combined will give the holder power to rule all. The inhabitants of the Demon Realm had long fought for possession of this infinite power until one gargoyle emerged victorious: the red demon known as Firebrand. At the end of his final battle, Firebrand was ambushed by his nemesis, Phalanx, and the stones are stolen. Now, Firebrand must recover the stones before humans and demons fall under Phalanx’s sinister rule. Breathe fire, claw walls, and hover across seven intense levels of the Demon Realm. Gain new transformations and abilities as you fight your way through Phalanx’s forces. With three different endings to experience, twenty-five hidden items to discover, and six magical stones of cosmic power to control, can you save the realms from total anarchy?</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Can Dixie Kong manage a rescue mission with a toddler?

Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have gone missing! As Dixie Kong checks in with the rest of the family, she gets stuck with babysitting duties! But that won't stop her from going on her next adventure!

Play as Dixie Kong or Kiddy Kong solo, against a friend, or with a friend! Take advantage of each of their unique abilities as they throw each other into action in over 40 levels. There are plenty of collectibles—including Bear Coins, which grant access to the services of the Brothers Bear, and Banana Birds, which Wrinkly Kong has a deep fondness for. You can also call on Funky Kong to build some wild vehicles for you to try to get to places that seem far out of reach. Not to mention there are animal friends to fight at your side! The final showdown takes place in a cliff-top laboratory at the End of the World. Things could get seriously ugly, so you'd better be ready!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The first great 3D platformer goes Virtual.

On a bright, sunny day in Mushroom Kingdom, Mario goes to visit the princess, but finds her castle eerily empty. Leaping through pictures hanging from the walls, he enters 15 magical worlds in a quest to collect the 120 Power Stars pilfered by evil Bowser and save the day. The game's vast worlds teem with daunting obstacle courses, hidden items, puzzles and more than 30 types of enemies. Take advantage of Mario's large selection of moves, including running, jumping, swimming, stomping, and punching, and even performing a backward somersault! Special caps give him short-lived powers, including the ability to fly. Super Mario 64 features unmatched camera control that makes adventuring in its 3-D world a snap, even for newcomers.</synopsis>

			<title>Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</title>
			<synopsis>Venture beyond Dream Land, and stop the power-hungry Dark Matter. Kirby™ stars in his first 3D adventure, which is also his Nintendo 64™ debut. This game finds the always-versatile hero battling a new enemy called Dark Matter. Dark Matter is after a distant land's powerful crystal, but a young fairy named Ribbon attempts to save it by escaping with the gem to Dream Land. Now the crystal has been broken, and it's scattered around the world. Take control of Kirby, and help him journey across six worlds, battling a wide variety of enemies and challenging bosses, as he tries to collect all 100 pieces of the shattered crystal. Along the way, you'll use Kirby's trademark Copy Ability to use enemies' strengths against them. Not only that, but try combining any two abilities to create a brand-new one that is usually stronger than the original. Throw in three exciting multiplayer minigames, and you've got a package of which even King Dedede would be proud. Fans of Kirby and action games with bright, colorful graphics should vacuum this one up.</synopsis>

			<title>Hoshi no Kābī Rokujuyon</title>
			<synopsis>Venture beyond Dream Land, and stop the power-hungry Dark Matter. Kirby™ stars in his first 3D adventure, which is also his Nintendo 64™ debut. This game finds the always-versatile hero battling a new enemy called Dark Matter. Dark Matter is after a distant land's powerful crystal, but a young fairy named Ribbon attempts to save it by escaping with the gem to Dream Land. Now the crystal has been broken, and it's scattered around the world. Take control of Kirby, and help him journey across six worlds, battling a wide variety of enemies and challenging bosses, as he tries to collect all 100 pieces of the shattered crystal. Along the way, you'll use Kirby's trademark Copy Ability to use enemies' strengths against them. Not only that, but try combining any two abilities to create a brand-new one that is usually stronger than the original. Throw in three exciting multiplayer minigames, and you've got a package of which even King Dedede would be proud. Fans of Kirby and action games with bright, colorful graphics should vacuum this one up.</synopsis>

			<title>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</title>
			<synopsis>If Ocarina of Time is an epic, then Majora's Mask can only be described as an epic epic. This time Link, the Hyrulian Hero, struggles against time to unravel the unsettling mystery of Majora's Mask. This mind-bending follow-up to Ocarina of Time sparkles with an artistic flair and presents a premise that shatters the foundation upon which most games are built. Perpetually reliving the same three days and three nights, Link is able to explore his world and relate to other characters like never before. Plot is often an afterthought in video games, but it is the driving force in Majora's Mask. The storyline meanders through the game like a living creature, poking around here and there to reveal greater insight into the land of Termina. Link is a well-armed detective in this mysterious adventure, gaining greater insight into the lives of established characters and meeting fresh faces as well. At first glance Majora's Mask appears to be uncharacteristically dark and brooding, but in fact it is usually the fear of the unknown which creates this uneasy mood. As Link gains knowledge, the world becomes less intimidating. The mystery begins a mere three months after Link's triumph over Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time. Now downtrodden, Link guides Epona through a sombre fog in search of his faithful fairy friend Navi. To Epona's surprise, two mischievous fairies materialise out of the mist and send Link's steed into a panicked retreat. These two fairies turn out to be siblings, appropriately named Tatl and Tael. As Link falls to the ground and loses consciousness, a disguised Skull Kid emerges from the fog. Both merry and macabre, the masked marauder steals Link's Ocarina and immediately mounts Epona. Link gives chase of course, completely unaware that he is pursuing not a mere Skull Kid, but one possessed by the mystical power of Majora's Mask. At the conclusion of their flight, Link unwittingly follows the Skull Kid through a powerful portal, which leads to a parallel universe. This new land is called Termina, and although it contains many of the same features and inhabitants as Hyrule, it is a unique world which is only familiar to Link in an unsettling sort of way. It doesn't take Link long to learn that he has arrived in Termina at the most inopportune of times. Not only is there a Skull Kid on the loose driven by the dark power of Majora's Mask, but the very moon itself will plunge through the atmosphere and devastate the land in a mere three days. Link knows that this is no mere coincidence. Before dawn on the fourth day, Link must somehow solve the mystery of Majora's Mask and save Termina from the lunatic mission of its own moon. Masks play a vital role in Link's Terminian adventure. Early in his quest, Link encounters a travelling salesman from the Happy Mask Shop. It's not immediately clear whether this shady character is aligned with the forces of good or evil, but he claims to be the rightful owner of Majora's Mask. It is this travelling salesman who places a three-day time limit on Link's exploits, coincidentally coinciding with the inflexible schedule of the falling moon. The nomadic representative of the Happy Mask Shop gives Link his first mask, the Deku Mask. While wearing this mask, Link is able to do business with Deku Scrubs who would normally ignore him in human form. When Link wears the Goron Mask, he inhabits the body of a fallen Goron named Darmani. Goron Link is one of the most unusual Gorons you'll ever see. While disguised as the rock-munching Darmani, Link is equipped with a powerful punch and the ability to roll up into a speeding spiked wheel. When Link picks up the Zora Mask and transforms into a Zora, he instantly gains the ability to speed through the water like a dolphin. Obviously, many of the puzzles in Majora's Mask require Link to use the primary transformation masks listed above. There are over 20 additional masks, though, which can help him other ways. Some masks allow Link to talk with specific characters, while others give Link special powers like the ability to run more quickly. At times, the possibilities seem endless.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Get ready to party like it’s the year 2000 all over again, complete with fancy costumes, bags of surprises, and games galore! Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends return for a brand-new round of Bowser-bashing board game action in Mario Party 2. Each of your favorite characters don different themed outfits to take part in five fun-packed Adventure Boards: Pirate Land, Western Land, Space Land, Mystery Land, and Horror Land.

Up to four players can play, traveling around the boards and competing in minigames for coins, while also using items to gain an advantage. Win the most stars and become the ultimate victor: the Super Star. Or, if you simply feel like proving your minigame mettle, visit Mini-Game Land to purchase and play minigames that you played during the game. Head to the Mini-Game Stadium and replay your favorites, including the Item, Battle, Duel, and Chance Time minigames! </synopsis>

			<synopsis>What do you do when your first party is a raging success? You throw another one, of course! Mario and all of his famous friends have long since RSVP'd for Mario Party 2, so you'd be a fool to miss this fiesta. Like the original Mario Party, this star-studded sequel allows up to four players to compete in exciting interactive board games packed with surprises. Mario Party 2 features six all-new multiplayer Adventure Boards, and a special Quest Mode for players who prefer to party alone. There are 64 action-packed mini-games in Mario Party 2. Most of these games present brand new challenges, and some are updated versions of the best mini-games from the first Mario Party. Mario Party 2 expands on the great visual style that was established in the original game. Each Adventure Board features a unique theme, and the characters dress differently depending on where they are playing. Nothing delivers more replay value than great multiplayer gaming, and Mario Party 2 has been developed specifically for that purpose. The first Mario Party Pak was a hoot, and Mario Party 2 has enough atmosphere and new surprises to keep your shindig raging all night long.</synopsis>

The island has many types of climates and environments to explore, along with secret activities and hidden passages to discover. Some of the Pokémon can be a little shy and won’t pose for the camera unless you tease them with special items! After you’re done, submit one picture of each Pokémon to Professor Oak, and he’ll judge it based on size, pose, technique, and number of Pokémon captured. Start practicing if you want to snap the perfect shot!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Have you ever wanted to see Pikachu in its natural habitat? In Pokémon Snap, you will capture lots of Pokémon found in the wild – not with a Poké Ball, but with a camera! Some shots are easy, like snapping Pikachu relaxing on the beach, but others are much more difficult, such as taking the picture of Pikachu riding on the back of a rare, flying Pokémon! In Pokémon Snap, you're on assignment from Professor Oak, the world-famous Pokémon professor. He needs lots of photos taken on Pokémon Island, where you'll cross six fascinating environments in search of all the Pokémon you can find. Pidgey will soar over your shoulder on the Beach. Diglett will pop up in the Tunnel. A group of Charmander will run by in the Volcano. And that's only in the first three environments! Wait until you see all the lively Pokémon in the River, Cave and Valley. When you return to Professor Oak's lab, he'll score your photos based on several merits: Did you capture the Pokémon in a great pose? Does its size fill the photo frame? Is it centred within the shot? And have you snapped more of the same kind of Pokémon in the background? Taking photos on Pokémon Island is a lot of fun, but it's a true test of your photography skills, too! You've still gotta catch 'em all – this time with a good eye and a quick camera snap!</synopsis>

Near death, Samus™ is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA of the last Metroid--the X parasite's only natural predator. When the X spread to a research station in orbit around SR388, a weakened Samus is forced to exterminate them all...or die trying.

Experience classic Metroid game play as Samus explores the secret passages of a massive research station teeming with hostile life forms. Master moves such as clinging to ledges, leaping to high ladders, and firing new weapons like Diffusion Missiles. Along the way, collect classic power-ups like the Morph Ball, Screw Attack, and Wave Beam. All these skills will be useful when you encounter the SA-X, an unstoppable X mimicking Samus, which is on the loose and could be just around the corner...</synopsis>

Forces of darkness are now pursuing the lost art of Alchemy, and as they draw ever closer to their foul purpose, mankind hangs in the balance.

			<title>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</title>
			<synopsis>Explore Hyrule and the miniature land of the Minish.

Don the Minish Cap to shrink Link™ down for his most massively microscopic adventure ever! Mere blades of grass will tower over your head as you explore Hyrule, conquering enemies, puzzles, dungeons and bosses as you go. Along the way, you’ll wield powerful items, fuse magic Kinstones and befriend the elusive Minish to stop the evil sorcerer Vaati.

The Minish Cap plays a pivotal part in the Four Swords storyline of the Legend of Zelda™ series, and is the first and only game in which Link explores the land of the Minish—a tiny, mysterious kingdom on the very surface of Hyrule. That makes this unique entry in the Zelda series a must-play for new and old fans alike. Inventive items like the Mole Mitts and Gust Jar give Link powers he’ll need to use wisely if he wants to save the puzzling world of Hyrule and the miniature land of the Minish. When there’s a princess to save, a bad guy to beat, and you’re THIS small, the stakes will never be higher.</synopsis>

Along the way, you’ll wield powerful items, fuse magic Kinstones and befriend the elusive Minish to stop the evil sorcerer Vaati.

The Minish Cap plays a pivotal part in the Four Swords storyline of the Legend of Zelda™ series, and is the first and only game in which Link explores the land of the Minish—a tiny, mysterious kingdom on the very surface of Hyrule. That makes this unique entry in the Zelda series a must-play for new and old fans alike. Inventive items like the Mole Mitts and Gust Jar give Link powers he’ll need to use wisely if he wants to save the puzzling world of Hyrule and the miniature land of the Minish. When there’s a princess to save, a bad guy to beat, and you’re THIS small, the stakes will never be higher.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The kingdom of Renais lies in ruins, shattered by a sudden invasion from a former ally. Use cunning strategy to guide the royal heirs, Eirika and Ephraim, on their twin quest to rebuild Renais. Take advantage of your strengths and exploit your enemy’s weaknesses, but be careful. If a soldier perishes on the battlefield, they are gone forever! In a world of dragons and magic, you must always be ready for battle. Take advantage of the terrain and the weapon in your hand, and attack enemies either from afar using magic or up close with your sword. Each weapon has its own strength and weakness, so choose wisely when attacking your opponent, because you don’t want to be caught off guard. Build the perfect army. Do you want a pegasus rider or a wyvern rider? An assassin or a rouge? Upgrade your troops to different classes, each with their own skills and weapon choices.</synopsis>

The year is 2035, and Soma Cruz is about to witness the first solar eclipse of the 21st century when he suddenly blacks out—only to awaken inside a mysterious castle. As Soma, you must navigate the castle's labyrinths while confronting perilous monsters at every turn with physical attacks and magical spells. Using the Tactical Soul system, collect souls of enemies to learn their abilities and equip them to activate new powers. But beware—you must escape before evil consumes you! Once you've survived the horrors of the castle, there are four other modes waiting for you to try.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Dr. Weil and Omega are plotting to use the Dark Elf's power to seize command of Neo Arcadia. Zero must use everything at his disposal to stop their plan before all hope and life is lost! Two months after stopping a possessed Elpizo, Zero and the Resistance are sent out to investigate a mysterious ship that is emitting a familiar energy source. As Zero takes a closer look, he discovers that Dr. Weil and Omega—both banished from Neo Arcadia long ago—have returned and are seeking the power of the Dark Elf. With it, they will destroy all humankind and take over Neo Arcadia for themselves. Use Zero's jump, dash, and wall kick to get to your next challenge. When a simple attack doesn't suffice, equip EX Skills, Cyber-elves, and other special items to boost your abilities. Travel to Cyberspace, and discover the mirror image of the current world. Stay steadfast on your course to return peace to a world that is on the brink of destruction!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Dr. Weil and Omega are plotting to use the Dark Elf's power to seize command of Neo Arcadia. Zero must use everything at his disposal to stop their plan before all hope and life is lost! Two months after stopping a possessed Elpizo, Zero and the Resistance are sent out to investigate a mysterious ship that is emitting a familiar energy source. As Zero takes a closer look, he discovers that Dr. Weil and Omega—both banished from Neo Arcadia long ago—have returned and are seeking the power of the Dark Elf. With it, they will destroy all humankind and take over Neo Arcadia for themselves. Use Zero's jump, dash, and wall kick to get to your next challenge. When a simple attack doesn't suffice, equip EX Skills, Cyber-elves, and other special items to boost your abilities. Travel to Cyberspace, and discover the mirror image of the current world. Stay steadfast on your course to return peace to a world that is on the brink of destruction!</synopsis>

			<title>Car Battler Joe</title>
			<synopsis>The road to becoming a car battler is not an easy one. Nobody knows why your dad, champion car battler Jim Todoroki, suddenly abandoned the fastest and most popular sport in Galacia. There is a rumor going around that he's riding around with the most ruthless car-battler gangs in the world. But is it just a rumor, or is there truth behind it? Play as Joe Todoroki, in his quest to become a car battler—like his father before him. His mother says he has the talent, but hard work will be the payoff. Customize a vehicle in the Garage to enhance or diminish its performance. Sign up for jobs, missions, and even tournaments as Joe explores the dangerous highways and byways that surround his village. Other car battlers fight for money and fame, but Joe has a higher calling: to restore his family's honor and bring his father home!</synopsis>

			<title>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</title>
			<synopsis>The Game Boy Advance strategy sensation comes to Nintendo DS! Confront the deadly Black Hole Army's invading forces, in tactical battles that play out across both of the DS' screens. New Commanding Officers join familiar faces - with a total of nine new characters, now you possess even more options in battle. Taking full advantage of the DS' capabilities, there are two kinds of battle, Normal and DS. In Normal mode the battle map appears on the touch screen while you use the top screen to keep tabs on key information about your units and your enemies! DS Battle mode lets you take a more all-encompassing view, using both screens to display the action as you and Black Hole clash in mortal combat. This means you can oversee two separate battles at the same time, or move troops from one screen to the other. With tanks, fighter planes and rocket launcher-carrying troops to command, you've more firepower at your disposal than ever before - but the enemy isn't lacking either... The formidable single player campaign will test even the shrewdest of military strategists, while the real-time combat mode provides immediate action if you want a break from the turn-based turmoil. You can also take on your friends across dozens of new maps, as well as several classics from previous Advance Wars games. Up to eight players can battle one another from just one Game Card, using the game-sharing ability of the DS. And with the Map Edit mode you can even use the touch screen and stylus to create your own maps, then send them on to friends!</synopsis>

			<title>Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia</title>
			<synopsis>Become a Top Ranger and protect hundreds of different types of Pokémon from an evil corporation in Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. The second title in the Pokémon Ranger series once again calls on you to capture Pokémon on the Touch Screen, and then use their abilities to save the day. This time around, however, you’ll encounter 50 additional Pokémon that weren’t in the original game, including many from Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl. Starting out in Ranger School as a Student Ranger, you’re bursting with enthusiasm at the prospect of one day becoming a Top Ranger and using your knowledge for the good of Almia and its many Pokémon. Little did you know, after graduation you would soon be putting your new skills to work in a quest that would determine the very future of the region. Playing as either a boy or girl Ranger, it will be up to you to find and capture Pokémon that can aid you on your journey. To do so, you’ll need to use the Capture Styler, a special tool that enables you to capture Pokémon by drawing lines around them on the Touch Screen using your stylus. Whether or not you successfully catch Pokémon will be determined by the strength of your Capture Styler and the ability to call on help at the right moment from Friend and Partner Pokémon you have already caught. Once a Pokémon joins your ranks, you will be able to use its unique Field Move skills to overcome obstacles in your path before releasing it back into the wild. As you progress through Missions and Quests, you’ll earn the right to have more Pokémon by your side, making it possible to open up and explore new areas of the sprawling Almia. Missions will be set for you by the Ranger Base or Ranger Union and see you tackling forest fires or exploring underground caverns. You’ll also have to put your Ranger abilities to the test against huge bosses as you work towards uncovering the true intentions of the shadowy Team Dim Sun organisation. On top of the game’s main Missions, people you meet will ask you to undertake Quests. Successfully completing these Quests earns you power-ups for your Capture Styler, making it stronger against certain attacks, lengthening the capture line and much more. With hundreds of Pokémon to encounter, a huge game world to explore and dozens of daring Missions to undertake, Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia will challenge you to go from zero to hero and establish yourself as the greatest Pokémon Ranger of all time!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Nintendo presents: Style Boutique challenges you to run your own fashion store as a style consultant, hand-pick your own stock, take part in Fashion Contests, choose new clothes from the online shop and even play against other consultants with multiplayer mode. Working your way up from shop assistant in a store, you can offer clothing advice and outfits for customers. With each customer having their own style and personality, you need to choose their clothes carefully to make a successful sale. Soon you’ll be the owner of your own store and using your creativity to style the mannequins, dictate the atmosphere by choosing the interior and music, create promotional Mailouts and decide when to hold sales. Each sale brings extra funds into the store enabling you to buy more stock. With invites to Fashion Contests in the Contest Hall appearing regularly in your diary, you can keep up with the latest fashion trends. Visit the Exhibition Hall where you can choose from over 10,000 items from 16 different brands and styles to place in your store in order to create the season’s ‘must-have’ trend. But remember, becoming a boutique owner requires great dedication, careful planning and hard work – get the right stock right otherwise you’ll be out of business. As well as managing your own Nintendo presents: Style Boutique store, you also have a bachelorette pad full of the latest designs – from tartan to tulip skirts and high-top trainers to knee-high boots – spend hours choosing the right outfit whilst changing your hair and make-up to suit your fashion creation. If the myriad of colour palettes in your hair and make-up kit don’t take your fancy, pop to the Hair Salon or Beautician for a make-over. With dozens of hairstyles, hair colours and highlights to choose from, you’ll be able to work the geisha look or go for a cropped pixie cut with ease. As for make-up, not only will you be spoilt for choice with lipstick, eye-shadow and mascara, but you can purchase coloured contact lenses and change the shape of your eyebrows!

			<title>Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs</title>
			<synopsis>Get ready for an exciting adventure in the third instalment of the action-packed Pokémon Ranger series: Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs. Take on the role of a Pokémon Ranger tasked with protecting the local people and wild Pokémon from the nasty Pokémon Pinchers with the help of your partner, Ukulele Pichu. To save the land from the powers of darkness, join forces with the Legendary Pokémon and stop the Pokémon Pinchers from their evil plans! Capture and befriend Pokémon by circling them with the Capture Styler on the Touch Screen. Pokémon that you befriend will support you on your adventure by using their abilities to clear obstacles that stand in your way or by helping you capture even stronger Pokémon. For the first time in the series, you can call Pokémon to your aid by drawing their Ranger Sign on the Touch Screen. There are many Pokémon available to support you, as well as a number of Legendary Pokémon, including Raikou, Entei and Suicune. As a Pokémon Ranger, your day will often involve being sent on a Mission, which may involve finding a missing person, stopping a natural disaster or protecting the peace in another dramatic way. If you are successful and complete the Mission, then the game story will advance. Each chapter in the game features a series of dynamic tasks and puzzle-solving challenges using the powers of the Pokémon. For example, you may call upon a Pokémon in the Water-group to help put out a fire.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>It takes both screens of the Nintendo DS to capture the spectacular scenery of Yoshi's Island!

Return to the colorful wilds of Yoshi’s Island in a new platforming adventure for Nintendo DS.

A mysterious floating island has suddenly appeared over peaceful Yoshi’s Island. Soon after its arrival, a gaggle of kids vanishes from the island school. Thankfully, Baby Mario, Baby Peach, Baby Donkey Kong and Baby Wario manage to avoid being kidnapped. Now, Yoshi and the four young superstars must set out on a wild and colorful quest to rescue the kids and investigate the ominous island hovering overhead. Thanks to the power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of Yoshi's Island span two screens.

The Yoshis populating this wild and mysterious island take turns transporting the babies. Each baby gives Yoshi access to unique powers while they cling to his back: Baby Mario gives Yoshi speed; Baby DK gives him strength and the ability to climb vines; with her umbrella, Baby Peach gives him the ability to float high, and Baby Wario gives him magnetism (perfect for grabbing grown-up Wario's favorite things: coins!).

Classic enemies are back, as are many all-new ones. Yoshi's Island DS makes great use of the double screens. Scroll up and down to see what lives above and beneath. Hurl eggs at objects on the top screen and tackle super-tall enemies that fill both screens.

Yoshi's Island DS sets a new standard on replayability. Hidden in every level are flowers, stars, red coins, and character coins, so even after you finish the game, the terrific sense of surprise continues. Enjoy the many minigames and bonus levels, too!</synopsis>

			<title>WarioWare: Touched!</title>
			<synopsis>The greediest, most ruthless CEO ever gets touchy-feely with the DS.

Wario makes his mad debut on the Nintendo DS with 180 all-new, factory-fresh microgames!

What really makes this game rock is the DS's touch control. Whether you're slicing veggies flying through the air or ripping the clothes off a sweltering beachgoer, the touch control makes playing Wario's blazingly fast microgames so simple, even a nintendo.com writer can figure 'em out.

Did we only say &quot;touch&quot;? Sorry, we forgot mic control. Yep, a karaoke-mad robot named Mike is on hand to get this party going with special mic-controlled games. For the absolutely first time in video-game history, you can blow sweet nothings into the ear of that someone special or cool off a cup of hot java.

The Usual Gang of Wing Nuts

Touch the latest fruits from the bizarro developers of WarioWare Inc. (GBA and Nintendo GameCube). Expect to make lots of spins and whirlpools to win Dr. Crygor's Slightly Unscrewed microgames. Kickin' kindergartners Kat and Anna return with a dojo's worth of Ninja Scribble microgames. Scooter girl Mona has made a career move from the gelateria to the pizza delivery business, but she's also found time to become a pop diva and, of course, develop a whole new set of extremely cuuute microgames.

That madcap taxi-driving duo, Dribble and Spitz, and way-out alien Orbulon return in wholly unpredictable supporting roles. Old-school grade-schooler 9-Volt is joined by his big brother, 18-Volt, to make five-second gems inspired by classic Nintendo games. This time, he's even gotten inspiration from Gold Digger, one of the classier offerings (not!) from WarioWare Inc. GBA.

Disco heartthrob Jimmy T. is back, along with his mom, dad, James (&quot;Jimmy's chick-magnet brother&quot;), Jamie (&quot;Jimmy's disco-fabulous sis&quot;). Remix masters James and Jamie each spins their favorite microgames.

New software developers this time are Ashley, a goth girl whose games are a &quot;Total Drag,&quot; and Mike, the aforementioned party robot. Ashley's hilarious theme song is worth the price of admission by itself.

You can also feed a special something to Wario to create Wario-Man, who looks like one of those masked Mexican wrestlers. &quot;Faster than a doughnut! Stronger than cardboard!&quot; (we kid you not), Wario-Man's boss battle challenges you to plumb the depths of someone's nose for buried treasure.

Microgame Madness
Some of the many all-new microgames include:

    Shakedown Knock the fruits from the trees.
    Pet Petter Pet a dog or cat. Awww!
    Washed Up Make like a mom and scrub a kid's dirty face.
    Quite Puzzled Slide the panels to complete the picture.
    Got the Chops Slice the veggies, chop-chop!
    Crowd Control Hey, you're a superstar with no time for groupies. Blow 'em off!
    Fresh Squeezed Milk the cow.
    Pro Bowling You get three balls to knock down the pins, which may be in strange formations.

But there's even more bonus games! How about Orbit Ball, an insanely addictive game in which you jot down lines that morph into trampolines that a grinning ball bounces off of. Can you put Mr. Goof Ball into outer space? There's even a two-player table-tennis sim, in which one player swings a paddle by pressing the L Button and the other uses the R Button.

Bottom Line

Easily one of the most inspired and unpredictable games on the GBA, WarioWare makes the leap to the DS in fine style. Touch the madness at a store near you now!</synopsis>

			<title>Sawaru Made in Wario</title>
			<synopsis>The greediest, most ruthless CEO ever gets touchy-feely with the DS.

Wario makes his mad debut on the Nintendo DS with 180 all-new, factory-fresh microgames!

What really makes this game rock is the DS's touch control. Whether you're slicing veggies flying through the air or ripping the clothes off a sweltering beachgoer, the touch control makes playing Wario's blazingly fast microgames so simple, even a nintendo.com writer can figure 'em out.

Did we only say &quot;touch&quot;? Sorry, we forgot mic control. Yep, a karaoke-mad robot named Mike is on hand to get this party going with special mic-controlled games. For the absolutely first time in video-game history, you can blow sweet nothings into the ear of that someone special or cool off a cup of hot java.

The Usual Gang of Wing Nuts

Touch the latest fruits from the bizarro developers of WarioWare Inc. (GBA and Nintendo GameCube). Expect to make lots of spins and whirlpools to win Dr. Crygor's Slightly Unscrewed microgames. Kickin' kindergartners Kat and Anna return with a dojo's worth of Ninja Scribble microgames. Scooter girl Mona has made a career move from the gelateria to the pizza delivery business, but she's also found time to become a pop diva and, of course, develop a whole new set of extremely cuuute microgames.

That madcap taxi-driving duo, Dribble and Spitz, and way-out alien Orbulon return in wholly unpredictable supporting roles. Old-school grade-schooler 9-Volt is joined by his big brother, 18-Volt, to make five-second gems inspired by classic Nintendo games.

You can expect all of the action from a classic Kirby game, but this time, Kirby’s Copy Abilities have been massively boosted. Not only can you mix and match Copy Abilities by using the stylus to drag them together inside Kirby's belly, but the powers themselves now have the ability to affect the environment as well as foes. For example, you can burn trees and grasses with the Fire ability or freeze water with the Ice ability. The massive array of Copy Abilities in Kirby: Squeak Squad will appeal to any Kirby fan, and a collection of well-hidden treasure chests to discover will reward players looking to find every last secret.</synopsis>

			<title>Kirby: Power Paintbrush</title>
			<synopsis>Roll with it! Kirby’s been cursed by a wicked witch and transformed into a ball. And to make matters worse, Dreamland has been turned into a painting. So it’s up to you to guide Kirby to the goals and save the land from this colourful calamity. Using the Touch Screen and stylus, you paint rails in magic ink for Kirby to ride on like a twisting, turning rollercoaster – smashing into bad guys as he goes. You’ll need nimble stylus skills to lead Kirby through all eight technicolour levels made up of mechanical monstrosities, dark caverns, lethal lava flows, spooky mazes, arctic snowfields and underwater labyrinths. In true Kirby style, you can also copy the powers of your fallen enemies; transforming Kirby into a blazing fireball, a high-speed wheel, a missile, a block of ice, a balloon and even a mass of sticky needles. As well as the main adventure portion of the game, Kirby: Power Paintbrush also features boss game challenges, a time attack mode and line attack (in which you must try to reach the goal using as little ink as possible).</synopsis>

			<synopsis>All aboard for adventure as Link sets off on a quest to restore the spirit tracks and keep an ancient demon locked away. Take control of your own train as you explore the vast land by rail. As the conductor you plan the route, set the speed and watch out for enemies and obstacles, clearing the path with the powerful built-in cannon. Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armour that responds to his commands. Tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm. While conducting the train, enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as you determine which track to take and how to best manipulate your speed. Plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles, fire the onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train, or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks! You can also use a variety of weapons and items, including the Whirlwind and Spirit Pipes, by blowing into the microphone!</synopsis>

			<title>Kirby Mass Attack</title>
			<synopsis>If you think one Kirby is fun, wait till you have a swarm of ten under your control in Kirby Mass Attack! When an evildoer with a magic cane appears one day, he uses his powers to split Kirby into ten pieces. In order to restore Kirby to his original form, you set off on a colourful, side-scrolling adventure, taking charge of up to ten Kirby at once to defeat enemies and solve inventive puzzles along the way. As you journey on your quest you’ll need to keep fully stocked up on fruit – the more you eat the more points you collect and more Kirby you create, giving you extra help on the mission. When you have more Kirby on hand, enemies are simpler to defeat, objects easier to move and puzzles less tricky to solve, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled for fruity treats. Some challenges also require assistance from a certain number of Kirby so don’t let your numbers get too low. In order to coordinate your attacks and use the Kirby to solve puzzles and hunt for treasure, the game is fully controlled with the stylus and Touch Screen. With a double tap, the mass of Kirby will dash towards the point and a flick of the stylus will make them jump, breaking objects if they get enough momentum. The Kirby will automatically attack enemies if set upon them en masse and when you hold your stylus on the Touch Screen, a star will appear which allows you to move the Kirby as a group by drawing a line. The Kirby aren’t invincible though. If they suffer damage, they will turn blue to show they’re wounded. In order to heal them, pass them through special rings on each level or if they are hit again, they will turn into angels and start flying away. You can help them though, by commanding your Kirby to jump up and pull down the angels to save them before they float away. Throughout the game there are a number of additional challenges to put you through your paces. By collecting medals hidden throughout the various stages, you can unlock a wide variety of additional mini-games, each with its own distinctive challenge. From counting the number of Kirby on the screen within a time limit, to pinball, shooting and much more, you’ll find hours of Kirby fun.</synopsis>

Once a Pokémon is in your possession you can call on its abilities in various ways; to clear obstacles in your path (such as using Torchic to burn through a bale of hay) or to help you capture more Pokémon (use a Grass-type Pokémon's Poké-Assist ability in your Styler to create grass and slow down your target Pokémon). But since you are a Ranger and not a Trainer, you must release each captured Pokémon back into the wild after they help you. Instead of a Pokédex, each Pokémon you capture is logged in your Capture Browser, and with more than 200 Pokémon to discover you'll have your work cut out as you work your way up the Ranger ranks.</synopsis>

Unlike other games, Animal Crossing doesn’t pressure you to complete levels, achieve scores or learn complex controls; you simply play however - and whenever - you want. For instance, at the start of the game you are given a house and a mortgage to pay, but you can choose to pay off that mortgage any way you wish. You could help out at the local shop, become a treasure hunter and donate your findings to the Town's museum, or make money selling T-shirts you designed yourself. The time in-game will pass in real time, so different activities and surprises happen depending on the time of the day. Return to the village frequently to discover special events only happening on certain dates, such as birthdays and other celebrations.</synopsis>

			<title>Gradius</title>
			<synopsis>An arcade conversion of Konami's classic shoot 'em up, Gradius is simple, no frills shooting action. The weapon system is fairly unique to the series, with power-up pod that cycles through a list of weapons at the bottom of the screen, allowing you to choose what you want, when you want it. The weapons themselves are fairly simple and range from bombs to diagonal shots or thin lasers. Given time, you can also amass a squad of 'options' that follow your ship and shoot when you shoot - very useful little buddies indeed. The levels are all space based, with lava-spewing volcanoes, mysterious Easter Island heads and destroyable walls to block your path. Gradius is a fine conversion of a classic, albeit an old classic. Your enjoyment will probably depend on how much you were into the original. I personally can take it or leave it - the design is a little bland and dated, although the interesting weapon system and sometimes intense action work in its favour. The main problem with Gradius is the terrible slowdown that the game suffers, which is a pity as it does affect the gameplay enough to become annoying and disruptive at times. Thankfully, Konami pulled their finger out for Parodius which does not suffer in the same way. So it's a good shooter, not exceptional, but mostly one for the existing fans.</synopsis>

			<title>Blazing Lazers</title>
			<synopsis>Blazing Lazers is a classic, one of the games that really sold the PC Engine to some people. Arcade quality graphics, sampled speech and some of the most impressive weapons you've seen. And be sure that it is a decent shoot 'em up, but it is not flawless. The main problem I have with the game is the pacing. The first few levels are, let's say, not the most exciting in the world. There is something about the timing of the enemy waves that seems a little slow and makes the game appear a bit empty compared to others. It's only when you get quite far into it that the difficulty ramps up and things really begin to kick off. This may seem like a minor gripe, but it does greatly affect my enjoyment of the game, as does the music. I've never really liked the music to Gunhed, it seems a bit too passive and doesn't set the mood for action. Basically this all boils down to two things I expect from a great shoot 'em up. The first is a great initial level to really gear me up for what is to come, the second is a kick-ass level 1 tune that complements the action perfectly. There are many examples of this (Super Star Solder, Nexzr, Spriggan, Soldier Blade etc.), but it's not something that Gunhed does well. I know this is on most people's 'must have' lists, but for my taste it has always fallen a little short of greatness and certainly doesn't compare to the successors from Hudson.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Alien Crush features a science fiction theme reminiscent of the film Alien. Essentially, the player is &quot;fighting&quot; against the aliens with their pinball skills. The playfield of Alien Crush consists of two main screens arranged vertically, with a pair of flippers at the bottom of each. The play stops momentarily as the ball shifts from one screen to the next. There are also several hidden/bonus rooms. These hidden rooms mainly involve destroying all the aliens (or several waves of aliens) for bonus points. The player is given the choice of a fast or slow ball speed and two different music tracks.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Be Ball is an action/puzzle game in which you have to roll coloured globes around the play area and deposit them on their relevant coloured squares. Once all balls are in place it's on to the next level. Easy, right? Well, maybe not, as there is all manner of wildlife out to put paid to your spherical antics, from hedgehogs to monkeys and penguins. Luckily, the balls themselves do have a use - give them a swift kick and they'll get rid of any creature barring your way. And if you are persistent, you can even whack down walls. Also, be on the lookout for various items scattered around that aid you in your task, like time-stops, smart bombs etc.</synopsis>

			<title>Salamander</title>
			<synopsis>The first player controls Vic Viper and the second player takes the reins of debuting spacecraft Lord British, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;Road British&quot; due to the ambiguity of Japanese-to-English romanization. The game features six stages which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling. Players are allowed to continue from where they leave upon death instead of being returned to a predefined checkpoint as per Gradius tradition. There are no continues in Salamander's single player mode; however, in the two-player mode, players are given two continues. The number of continues can be changed through DIP switches. The player gains power-ups by picking up capsules left behind by certain enemies, as opposed to the selection bar used in other Gradius titles. However, the Japanese version of Life Force keeps the selection bar. Many of the power-ups can be combined. For example, an option fires a second (or third) salvo of missiles or ripple/plutonic lasers if these power-ups have been option. The ripple and laser, however, are mutually exclusive. The only power-up that can survive the ship's destruction are the options. Upon the ship's destruction, the options float in space for a brief time before disappearing; the new ship can grab and retain them if they get to them first.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Power-up your spaceship and prepare for battle! This is a completely faithful port—right down to the character details—of the famous shooting-game masterpiece, R-TYPE. Destroy the POW armor and 1 of 6 different units will appear, which you can then use to power up your R-9. Equip Bits and obtain Laser Units to make the Force appear and to power it up. The Force can then be integrated into or separated from your R-9. Make the most of your weapons, including the Reflecting Laser Beams, Air-to-Surface, and Antiaircraft Lasers. Keep pressing the fire button to fire blasts from the Beam Cannon. Press and hold the fire button to charge the Beam Gauge, then release it to fire a devastating Wave Cannon blast! The longer you hold it, the stronger the blast! The ultimate highlights are the N32bosses that await you at the end of each stage, including a stage that pits you against a giant warship.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The Parodius (パロディウス Parodiusu?) series is a series of horizontally scrolling shooters developed by Konami. The games are tongue-in-cheek parodies of Gradius, hence the name (Parodius is a portmanteau of Parody and Gradius). It also parodies many other Konami franchises, including Antarctic Adventure, Castlevania, Xexex, Axelay,[citation needed] Thunder Cross, Taisen Puzzle-Dama, Space Manbow, Ganbare Goemon, Lethal Enforcers, Tokimeki Memorial and TwinBee.</synopsis>

Guide the TwinBee spacecraft as you dodge and destroy waves of aerial and ground enemies. If you get hit and lose both of your ship’s arms, find an ambulance for repairs quickly. Shoot through the clouds to uncover bells. Collect the bells for extra points, or continue to shoot at them to gain different upgrades for your ship. Additional power-ups can also be collected from the ground. Fly high in the sky with your anthropomorphic spacecraft in this new version of a classic.</synopsis>

			<title>Antarctic Adventure</title>
			<synopsis>The player takes the role of an Antarctic penguin, racing to disparate research stations owned by different countries in Antarctica (excluding the USSR). The gameplay is similar to Sega's Turbo, but plays at a much slower pace, and features platform game elements. The penguin, later named Penta, must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding sea lions and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending – when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty.</synopsis>

These Mii characters will appear in Miiverse and specially designed Wii U games, putting you right into the gaming experience! If you want a head start in creating your Mii, take a picture of yourself using the built-in camera on the Wii U GamePad. Mii Maker will automatically create a Mii. You can then edit further to complete your creation. You can transfer Mii characters created on a Nintendo 3DS system using either its QR Code® pattern, or via direct wireless communication. When you perform a Wii System Transfer, the Mii data on your Wii console will also be transferred. You can create fun photo shoots with your Mii character, or QR Code® patterns that can be shared with other Wii U and Nintendo 3DS owners. Using all of the various ways to create and import Mii characters, plus any Mii that visits to play over the Internet, you can save up to 3,000 on one Wii U console shared between all users.</synopsis>

			<title>Wii U Chat</title>
			<synopsis>Connect with friends and family—right on your TV. Wii U Chat enables video chat with friends and family who also have a Wii U console, from anywhere in the world. Enjoy video conversations with your loved ones, at no additional cost—all you need is your broadband Internet connection. See the smiling faces of friends and family from afar on your TV screen, and enjoy conversations as if they were right in your living room. Set the GamePad on a stand in front of the TV, and the wide-angle inner camera of the GamePad can get the entire family in the picture. Once you've registered a friend on your Wii U console, you can call them in just two easy steps. From your friend list, choose the Mii that represents the friend you'd like to call. You can see who's online from this list. Just touch the call button to place the call, and catch up with your friend in seconds. You can adjust the setting so that your online status is invisible to friends from the Friends List settings. Hand draw pictures or written text on the touch screen of the GamePad while you chat. You can share these drawings with your friend while chatting to add a creative and personal touch to your conversation. While playing a game, the HOME Button on the GamePad will emit a blue light when you have an incoming Wii U Chat call. From there, you can press the HOME Button to pause your game and take the call. If you've changed your setting so that your online status is not shown, the HOME Button will not light up when a call is received. Calls you missed while your Wii U console was off or calls that you didn't answer can be viewed from the &quot;Missed Calls&quot; list. You'll also receive a message in Miiverse letting you know that the call came in.</synopsis>
